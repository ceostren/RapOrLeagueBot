Not to mention the fact that everything they were saying was being blasted throughout the entire venue. \n\nFirst off, there were over a dozen teams in attendance last night. The only one that they chose to talk about: the Knicks. They talked unbelievably liberally about Zion going to NY, as if they had already won it. However, as I doubt any of them realized, the Knicks had the same chance of obtaining the #1 pick as the Cavs and the Suns, the latter of which I don\u2019t even think was mentioned once on the broadcast.\n\nThen, there was Zion. Rachel Nichols kept referring to the #1 pick as \u201cwho gets Zion.\u201d Every time she said that or mentioned the kid, the camera would cut to the embarrassed 18 y/o who was just there to see what team picks where. There is no guarantee that Zion will go #1 overall. It is very very likely, but not guaranteed. Not to mention that they did this in front of a large number of draft prospects in attendance. What does all of this coverage and press mean to them if it\u2019s only going to Zion?\n\nAnd finally, the Pelicans. Woj made every team\u2019s case for a possible AD trade that night. Whenever a team with chances of getting a top 10 pick was mentioned, Woj had to slip in that they may be looking to use that pick as an \u201casset\u201d to trade for AD. I\u2019m honestly very happy the Pelicans won because the disrespect they were receiving the whole night was greatly trumped when they won the first pick.\n\nNow I get all of these things are said ten times over on any other sports news broadcast. However, as I said, Rachel Nichols audio was blasted for everyone at the event to hear, including the draft prospects and team representatives. After watching this, I asked my dad if there was ever a time where the media would be able to speak this liberally about sports in front of all of those people. He said \u201cno.\u201d\n\nEDIT: Apparently, there are rumors circulating that Rachel Nichols was drunk.

(Repost from /Lakers) #UPDATE: http://imgur.com/gallery/c8btRei\n\nJustice is served! Josh reach out and sent me this.\nThank you everyone for you help and turning this into a success story!!!!!\n\nBack in the summer of 2017, we drafted Josh Hart out of Villanova with the 30th pick. I loved the pick cause I knew the kid was a baller and gave us some nice depth.\nHe made a tweet that summer while he was in Vegas getting ready for the summer league, about wanting to buy a Nintendo Switch. My little brother jokingly replied to him without expecting a response, but to our surprise, he did.\nThe conversation went as follows:\n\n http://imgur.com/gallery/WkSFMJm\n\nWe agreed on 200 dollars, tickets to a future game and the chance to meet with him for a Switch and Zelda Breath of the Wild. I shipped it to him overnight. As a life long Laker fan (I have a tattoo so I'm not playing around) I was ecstatic at having some kind of connection to a Laker, let alone one I genuinely liked.\n\nHe did PayPal me the 200 right when he got it, and he did reach out to me about what tickets I wanted. I asked him for the December 18th game...which was Kobe Bryant's jersey retirement. I knew the odds of getting those tickets were slim, but of course I'm going to shoot my shot at that game.\n\nThat was the last I heard from him. I have reached out to him through my personal Twitter, and my brother has attempted to as well. He reads the message, but never replies. I have joined his Twitch live streams and tried to get his attention there too, and he seems to ignore me there too.\n\nI have no ill will towards the man, I just want what we had agreed upon and not be ghosted. I feel waiting 2 seasons and still no tickets is pretty absurd at this point, and the lack of communication is the real ball buster.\n\nSo please Josh....just pay up bro.\n\nEDIT: http://imgur.com/gallery/mbNQqig \n\nSome personal DMs from me to him.

We recognize that this is a long delay so if you would prefer to have your money refunded, please reply to this email to start that process.\"\n\nI am a college student, so I quickly let this slip my mind and I forgot about it, until I randomly remembered earlier this month (June 2019) and decided to email the merch team asking for any updates. In his merch team's defense, I did receive a quick response (on June 7th, 2019), but it was not very helpful. All they said was that \"unfortunately, we still do not have a confirmed timeline of when we will be receiving more inventory of the KOD Signed Vinyl.\"\n\nThey did also offer, again, to provide a refund, but I am a broke college student, so the likelihood of me being able to afford VIP tickets to get an autograph from one of my all-time favorite artists is little to none right now.

The $37 I paid is not going to change my life right now, but I would really value adding this vinyl to the little collection I'm starting to build up.\n\nPlease spare an upvote so that MAYBE some slight social media traction might provoke a more timely-effort to give J.

I will kick your a**!\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHe then proceeded to throw a basketball at her for a second time, as hard as he could. He (potentially) received a fine of up to $1,000 and was suspended for 0 games. 500 times less than Mark Stevens got for his push. The fine was from a judge in a courtroom and not even from the league. The league did nothing. There is no mention of this on Lowry's wikipedia page. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf Lowry thinks $500,000 and a year ban is soft for Mark Stevens then I wonder what he thought about his $0, 0 game punishment for battery of a woman in 2012?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn August of 2010, beloved NBA clown Lance Stephenson pushed his pregnant girlfriend down a staircase and then proceeded to bash her head against the stairs. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nTwo years prior to this he sexually assaulted a 17 year old girl at his high school.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHe went on to play over 500 NBA games and earn over $35 million dollars. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt the time of the staircase attack, he hadn't played a single NBA game. 9 years later, he's still in the league. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI was a fan of Lance but only because I'd never heard this mentioned in a single one of his games. I even paid actual money to buy his Charlotte Hornets jersey. I wore his name and number on my back. Call me old fashioned, but I think that the second you bash your pregnant girlfriend's head against some stairs, you should forfeit the privilege of playing NBA basketball.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOJ Mayo and Tyreke Evans were both given 2 year bans for violating the NBA anti-drug program. The NBA is prohibited from disclosing what type of drugs they were found to have taken but reports suggest the violations were related to \"drugs of abuse\" which implies they were recreational and not performance enhancing.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nJason Kidd was fined $200 (by a judge) for abusing his wife. He was suspended for 0 games.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDarren Collison, Jason Kidd, Jason Richardson. The NBA has a history of letting abusers off lightly. All just because they're good at basketball.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm a firm believer in forgiveness and giving people second chances but if Kyle Lowry and NBA fans think Mark Stevens should be banned for life then Kyle Lowry should've never become a Raptor, Jason Kidd should not be the league's highest paid assistant coach and Lance Stephenson should've never played a minute in the NBA. \n\n&nbsp; thanks for this OP i had no clue about any of these except kidd", "class": "r/nba"}, {"text": "When Melo pranked fans at the wax museum... link Melo used to be so elite, I want to go back", "class": "r/nba"}, {"text": "Yao Ming on the state of Chinese basketball: \"If 10 years from now we still use Yao Ming to represent China, it's a failure on my job.

I can't believe I'm writing this. I also don't know why I'm so surprised. But... Here we go.\n\nI've seen a lot of hip hop shows, a lot of underground acts and this was the first show I was going to see a \"mumble rapper\". After seeing all his show footage it seemed like it'd be madness and I been following Lil Purp for over a year now. So we went to Starland Ballroom in NJ last night to go see him. Not only did I sit through 3 and a half hours of the worst openers I've ever seen, but the DJs were playing obnoxiously long sets with Lil Pump, XXX, and Ski Mask on repeat... but they were the same 3 songs. That's Okay, I thought, it's basically time for Smokepurpp.\n\nNot only did they keep saying one more song. Then three more songs and he'll come out.... He came out late as hell and he was leaning and geeked so hard.\n\nHere's his set list (did not play any of these all the way thru):\nAudi,\nGeek A Lot,\nBless Yo Trap,\nDrop,\nFingers Blue,\nAudi (again)\n\nWhat the fuck. I sat through 3.5 hours for a fucking 15 min set... where he played Audi twice. Not to mention 2 other songs he played in his set were Uzi and Waka songs.\n\nAftwr taking so long he said \"theres no rules for lil purpp\"... I feel like I was finessed by an artist I actually really fuck with. I'm pretty tight. \n\nTl/dr; Smokepurpp doesn't give a fuck about his fans dont go see him. Go see an artist that'll put on an actual show. \n\nEDIT: I am not saying fuck Smokepurpp I still think the dude makes enjoyable music, just a little warning to anyone thinkin about spending time or money at one of his shows. Purpp opened for post Malone and wow worst set I have ever seen. \n\nHe has no stamina, was out of breath after half a verse.\n\nHe said he was on xan and had to pee after performing one song. So he left for 10 minutes. Maybe he had to poo? He comes back 10 minutes later and was awful.\n\nI\u2019ve never seen a worse performance in my life.

I want to share it with you all and say thanks. Hey everyone, in the past six years you\u2019ve probably seen me around on r/hiphopimages or r/freshalbumart sharing my work, or the occasional times I actually stop lurking and post here. I want to give a big thanks to all of the content that is posted here (this includes the shitposting). It\u2019s helped me find inspiration and links to new music. Six years ago when I was a junior in college, I created my first hiphop illustrations of Lupe Fiasco and Kanye West. After I finished ten of them, I thought it would be sick if I made three more and turned them into a card deck! So I did that which you can see [here](http://imgur.com/a/RNC84 ). These were hand printed and cut (fun senior project). At this point I knew that I wanted to create a full 52 card deck. I just didn\u2019t know it would be five years later lol.\n\nThis has kind of been my passion project after work. I\u2019ll spend a few hours here and there, and some weekends working on this. It\u2019s not my full-time job, but I just enjoy creating and this has been an outlet for me. \n\nHere\u2019s a link to the full deck: \n\n[Hiphop illustrative card deck](https://imgur.com/gallery/AgDMsvu)\n\nBreakdown of which artists are on which card:\n\n[Breakdown Cards](https://imgur.com/a/EmZkXqn)\n\nI need to give a very large shoutout to my friend [Parker Gibson](https://www.instagram.com/helloparkerg/) whom I collaborated with on the Vince Staples, Freddie Gibbs, and Pusha T piece. As well as a shout out to [Frawgsy](https://www.instagram.com/frawgsy/) for working on the Ski Mask piece with me. These are both talented artists worth following. \n\nAlso I do have these for sale on my site [Brandonspahn.com](https://brandonspahn.com/shop/), but I don't want to make this post focused on that. I\u2019m just really proud of this work as I\u2019ve spent between 600-800 hours of my life working on it, and I wanted to share this link in case someone is interested. I set up a promo code for Reddit though, if you use \u201cReddit\u201d, you\u2019ll save 10%. I talked with the mods to make sure that this was okay to post as well. If you'd like to see more of my work or more detailed shots of the art, my instagram is https://www.instagram.com/brandonspahnart/.\n\nAnyways thanks again for this subreddit, it\u2019s the only one I\u2019ve been active on for all eight years of my Redditing.

And they've had the most chances to draft All-Stars too: the Hornets rank #1 with the lowest average draft spot in that time.\n\n* Then-coach Steve Clifford wanted the Hornets to draft Donovan Mitchell in 2017, but Rich Cho overruled him and drafted Malik Monk instead.\n\n* The Hornets were seriously looking to draft Pascal Siakam in 2016, but decided to trade their pick for Marco Belinelli who spent one year with the team before being traded to Atlanta in the Dwight Howard trade.\n\n* The Hornets were offered three first-round picks by the Celtics for the #9 pick in 2015. Michael Jordan turned the offer down to pick Frank Kaminsky. Kaminsky was always in the coach's doghouse here, his family hated Charlotte, and Kaminsky signed with Phoenix this offseason.\n\n* After having the worst record in NBA history in 2012, the Bobcats lost out on the #1 pick which was going to be Anthony Davis. They then selected Michael Kidd-Gilchrist with the #2 pick instead of Bradley Beal. In the same draft, they selected Jeffery Taylor with their 2nd round pick, just ahead of Draymond Green and Khris Middleton.\n\n* They did select Kemba Walker in 2011, but they also gave Stephen Jackson, Shaun Livingston, and the pick that would turn into Tobias Harris so they could jump up and draft Bismack Biyombo. They selected Biyombo instead of the player that had been mocked to them in several mock drafts: Kawhi Leonard. They also had Klay Thompson on the board.\n\n* The second best draft pick they've had since their 2004 rebirth has been Emeka Okafor.\n\n* They haven't won a playoff series since April 2002 when LeBron was in high school, Zion was 1 year old, The Scorpion King was #1 at the box office, Ashanti had the #1 song in America, and Hollywood Hogan was WWE Champion. The closest they've come to winning a series since then was the Purple Shirt Guy game when they were up 3-2 vs. the Heat and had cut a 9 point Heat lead to 2 with 1:30 left. A Hornets fan known as Purple Shirt Guy started inexplicably jawing with Dwyane Wade who proceeded to drop a quick 5 points to tie the series up. The Hornets would go on to lose Game 7 in Miami by 27 points.\n\n* Despite letting their best player ever walk for nothing, they're hard-capped at the moment. They'll be hard-capped this season with a starting 5 of Terry Rozier, Cody Zeller, Nic Batum, Dwayne Bacon, and Miles Bridges. Bismack Biyombo will be making $17 million off the bench, Marvin Williams will be making $15 million off the bench, and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist will be making $13 million off the bench. Nic Batum (who has turned into a completely worthless player) will be entering the 4th year of a 5 year deal (final year a player option) that will pay him $25.5 million. He'll almost certainly use that player option in 2020 and will be making $27.1 million.\n\n* The Hornets hired a new radio play-by-play guy before the start of the 2018-19 season that grew up a Hornets fan and was a beloved radio host in Charlotte. He was fired in the middle of a week in March with no explanation and no explanation has come out since.\n\n* Michael Jordan hasn't given an interview where he's discussed the Hornets in any detail (besides Kemba Walker) since 2014.\n\nSo as you bitch and complain about how your team hasn't done anything in a long time or how you only have one All-Star and you're disappointed you didn't get another, remember that things could always be worse. That is a long and damning list of failures.\n\nHorrible asset management.", "class": "r/nba"}, {"text": "LeBron James on Donald Trump disinviting the Eagles: \u201cIt\u2019s typical of him.

I told him they really should provide some kind of safeguards for buyers. He assured me that they aggressively go after any sellers who break their rules.\nI'd have rather got in to the final game, but I am happy with the outcome.\n__________________________________\n\n\n\n**TL:DR \u2013 StubHub sold my wife and I invalid tickets to the final game ever at Sleep Train Arena (ARCO Arena) \u2013 they did not notify me the tickets were bad, I found out when we got denied by the scanner at the door.  Then they kept me on hold for over 40 minutes outside the venue.  I missed the game and it could happen to you.**\n_______________\n\nLet me preface this by saying I do not blame the Kings or NBA for this situation, however I do think that they need to be aware of what one of their major resellers is doing to their fans.\n\nI am a Sacramento Kings fan - through thick and thin.  I scream about hating them, complain, and bemoan our lack of defense, lack of wins, lack of\u2026 everything.  We don\u2019t have much.  We haven\u2019t been to the playoffs in 10 years \u2013 the second longest drought in the NBA (behind the Wolves who I guarantee break that streak soon).  We have a superstar who teases us with his brilliance and then punishes us with his attitude and demeanor.  We went through an absolute nightmare of an ownership that tried not once, not twice, but three times to steal our team and take them to another city.  We just celebrated breaking thirty wins for the first time in nine years.  Yet I love the team to the core.\n\nI\u2019ve watched this team since I was a kid.  In the fourth grade, I had a Kings ruler with pictures of Danny Ainge, Wayman Tisdale, and Kenny Smith.  I had, and still have, only seen NBA games in a structure that has all of the sex appeal of a giant flat office building \u2013 Sleep Train Arena (it will always be ARCO to me).  \n\nThe entire basketball nation probably knows the plight of our dilapidated arena \u2013 tarps falling from the ceiling, leaks when it rains, toilets that don\u2019t work.  Yet we Kings fans love the place.  We always have.  It\u2019s the only real arena we have ever had \u2013 we don\u2019t have any other major league sports in our city and this place is just cozy and fits us.  \n\nIt is the perfect arena for a bunch of rabid fans in a city that Phil Jackson infamously called a \u201ccow town\u201d \u2013 unwittingly unleashing the birth of the very loud Kings cowbells.\n\nAfter all of the disasters of the previous ownership group, we finally were blessed by a man willing to save our team \u2013 Vivek Ranadive.  While we can argue his basketball knowledge and his hands on approach to basketball operations, we cannot argue that he saved the Sacramento Kings and ponied up a lot of money to build us a brand new arena in downtown Sacramento.\n\nWith that very arena scheduled to open this October, many of us Kings fans circled April 9, 2016 on our calendar; the final game at the \u201cold barn\u201d after 28 years.\n\nI was one of those people.  I frequently purchase my tickets from a variety of sources \u2013 Kings.com, eBay, StubHub, Craigslist, etc.  Where ever the best deal lies.  Some are obviously more risky than others \u2013 Craigslist comes to mind.  \n\nI would not fret about buying tickets from StubHub \u2013 I\u2019ve done it before plenty of times.  I hear their commercials all of the time on the radio.  I had no reason to believe that there was any risk buying tickets from their website.\n\nUnfortunately, I found out that I was completely wrong last night.\n \nYesterday, I bought tickets to the final game at Sleep Train with a scheduled tip off against the OKC Thunder at 7:30 pm.  I looked through StubHub and found a great dead for two tickets for my wife and I in Row H of the lower bowl.  The total price was $356.00 \u2013 expensive for a meaningless basketball game, but not for a once-in-a-lifetime event.  \n\nThe Kings were going to do it up big; tons of free giveaways, meet and greets with former players that spanned the entire Sacramento era, the opportunity to go out on the court and shoot a free throw and take pictures \u2013 it was going to be an amazing close to our shabby, but loved, arena.\n\nI [purchased the tickets a little after 5:00 pm yesterday from StubHub](https://imgur.com/COW0Khe).  At 5:22 pm, I received my email confirmation with the tickets.  I immediately took [screenshots](http://imgur.com/22fIc9n) of [both tickets](https://imgur.com/gvpW9B0) to scan at the door on my phone.  My wife and I got ready and we were on our way to drive the 30 or so miles to the arena.\n\nWe arrived at approximately 7:00 pm and by this point could see all of the news trucks, concession stands, and hear the music playing.  We were getting excited.  The parking lot was as full as I\u2019ve ever seen it.\n\nWe made our way past the security check point and walked up to the self-scanner at the door where I pulled up the screenshots of my tickets.  I scanned the first one at the turnstyle:  REFUND flashed on the screen.  I stood there for a second thinking maybe it didn\u2019t register so I tried again.  REFUND.\n\nAt this point, people were piling up behind me so I stepped aside feeling a little embarrassed \u2013 like I was some scammer or didn\u2019t know how to use the scanner.  This was where I felt my first pang of panic.  \n\nI pulled up the second ticket and slid back in line to try again.  REFUND.  I flagged down a door attendant who tried his hand scanner on both tickets: REFUND, REFUND.  It was 7:05 pm and I was in full on panic mode now.  \n\nThe door attendant advised me to go to the box office so we tore off in that direction. I desperately did not want to miss the last ever player introductions at this arena.  Inside the box office, I was sympathetically told by the attendant, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, this is a StubHub problem and we can\u2019t help you \u2013 you need to call them but they\u2019re very good at refunds.\u201d\n\nREFUND.  There\u2019s that word again.  \n\nI don\u2019t want a refund \u2013 I want to see this game!  And time is tick, tick, ticking away.  I grab my phone and literally type StubHub into google as fast as my fingers will let me.  I find the number and call.  After the automated message, the voice tells me the first thing I was dreading to hear, \u201call of our representatives are assisting other callers \u2013 we will be with you shortly.\u201d\n\nI am basically beside myself by now \u2013 I am down to about 15 minutes to tip off and I have no way through the door.  At 7:25pm, while still on hold, I got desperate and went back to the box office.  I asked the representative what the cheapest tickets were just to get in the building.  He tells me $160.00 each for nosebleed upper bowl tickets \u2013 plus fees.  \n\nI can\u2019t believe what I am hearing.  I still don\u2019t know the status of my StubHub tickets so now I am faced with the choice of buying these tickets in front of me for more than the lower bowl tickets that I should already have in my possession or continuing to wait on hold.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I am getting a refund or not for the StubHub tickets, since no one will answer the phone, and am afraid of buying four tickets.  The box office rep says to me, \u201cman, I\u2019m so sorry \u2013 we\u2019ve been seeing this all night from StubHub.\u201d\n\n7:25 pm, 7:30 pm, 7:40 pm, 7:45 pm\n\nBy 7:45 pm, I came to the realization that I was not going to see this game.  My wife and I started the most depressing, dejected walk back to our car imaginable.  About halfway there, the StubHub rep finally came on the line \u2013 after 40+ minutes on hold.  I calmly (as possible) explained my situation to him and asked him exactly what had happened.\n\nHe was unable to explain why my tickets would not work.  I asked him point blank, \u201cDid the guy who sold me these tickets also sell them to someone else.\u201d  He would not answer, just saying that sometimes there are issues with the tickets.  I kept pressing him, asking him why I was not notified that my tickets would not work before I got to the door.  At least then I would have had an opportunity to get different ones.  [The only email I received at that point was my confirmation](https://imgur.com/si3xBbk).  He told me that they do not monitor the transactions so if there is an issue, you will not know until you get denied at the door.\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe that I was not getting an answer as to why my tickets would not work.  I explained to him that this was not just any game \u2013 this is a one-time event.  I could tell that he was starting to understand the gravity of my situation.  I kept pushing him about the seller and how this happened.  That\u2019s when he dropped the bomb on me.\n\nHe said, and I quote, **\u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t tell you this, but the seller you bought these tickets from is already under investigation for selling bad tickets.\u201d**\n\nSo there it is \u2013 StubHub knew that this guy is selling bad tickets on their site.  Or at the very least, he is selling the same tickets to multiple people.  The rep told me that he would be investigated which mean absolutely nothing to me standing in the parking lot.  \n\nHe told me he would issue a refund for the price of the tickets and offered me 20% off of my next purchase.  It wasn\u2019t then, and it\u2019s not now, about the money.  We missed something that we had our heart set on.\n\nWe went to a nearby restaurant and watched the game on TV which honestly felt more painful.  It was basically everything we knew it would be; a great halftime show featuring the past players, sentimental videos, the roar of the sell-out crowd as the game came down to the final shot \u2013 with the Kings winning it with 1 second on the clock.  But it wasn\u2019t about the game on the court, it was about the atmosphere in the building.  And we missed it.\n\nThe final kick in the teeth came on the drive home as I listened to the post-game on AM radio.  During a commercial break there was a StubHub ad talking about their \u201cguarantee\u201d to get you in the game.  I couldn\u2019t believe it.  \n\nAs soon as I got home, I fired off an email to StubHub explaining what happened [PART 1](https://imgur.com/CsPS7id) and [PART 2](https://imgur.com/xhxoupa).  This morning, [I got the response which was basically a form letter](https://imgur.com/05E42wK) with some things changed in it.  They ask me to call them back so that they can further investigate.  I called them and the rep I spoke to had no idea why I was calling in, saying, \u201coh they already are looking into the seller.  They probably just wanted you to call to verify you received your refund.\u201d  I knew I got my refund last night!  \n\nI asked him if he at least saw the 20% discount on my account for my next purchase and he said, \u201cNo I don\u2019t see it but I will make sure I add it right now.  It\u2019s actually a 20% credit based on the purchase price of the tickets you already bought.\u201d  At this point, whatever.  So he tells me based on the price of $356.00, my credit on my account will be $71.20.  Not nearly what I think I should get for what I missed but I know I\u2019m not going to get anywhere with this guy.  He thanks me for using StubHub (!) and the call ends.\n\nA couple of minutes later, [an email comes through showing the credit issued to my account](https://imgur.com/Wjryil1).  $17.80.  Only missed the mark by $53.   At this point, I am at a loss for words.  \n\nI have sent off yet another email re-explaining everything and asking the questions:\n\n* Why does the seller retain control over tickets that he sold and [received money for](https://imgur.com/AlpkvTh)?\n\n* Why does StubHub not warn it\u2019s buyers that you will not make it in to your event if the seller chooses to take his tickets back and resell them to someone else?\n\n* Why was I never advised before I made it to the gate that I was not going to get in?  Had I been advised with enough time, I could have received my refund and still bought other tickets.  By the time I found out I wasn\u2019t getting in and then waited on hold for 40 minutes, I missed my chance to get in.\n\n- Why was the offer of equal or better seats never given to me at the time?  I would have been mad at missing the first quarter, but at least I would have seen the final three quarters.\n\n* Why is there not some sort of seller feedback system to warn buyers of fraudulent sellers similar to eBay?  By their own representative\u2019s admission, this seller was known to StubHub to be a potentially fraudulent seller.  Had I known this guy had issues, I obviously would have avoided the listing.\n\nHere is StubHub\u2019s guarantee [straight from their website](http://www.stubhub.com/fanprotect-update/):\n\n**Summary of StubHub guarantee to Buyers:**\n\n* *You will get your tickets in time for the event*\n\n* *Your tickets will be valid for entry*\n\n* *Your tickets will be the same as those you ordered*\n\n*If any of these things do not occur and you comply with applicable policies and timelines, we will find you comparable or better tickets to the event, or offer you a refund or FanCode for future purchase*\n\n\nI was never, at any point last night, offered comparable or better tickets.  Even though at that point, I would have been mad as I had already missed the first quarter.\n\n\nI apologize for the exceptionally long post.  I want to warn people about StubHub and tell everyone that this company is no better than buying from some stranger on Craigslist.  I hope this gains some traction so that no one else has to go through something as bad as this. I'm so sorry man. I myself intentionally didn't buy tickets for this game because I've heard stories in the past about how bad they are when it's a desirable game (so I only use them for random, non-important games), and I absolutely regretted not trying to get some tickets last night when I watched it on TV. \n\nAs a Kings fan of so many years, I would be absolutely devastated. I grew up with them, and I was kicking myself last night for not watching them leave Arco in person. I know it's not about the money. It's about not being able to say goodbye to your childhood home.\n\nI'm sorry that it happened to you.", "class": "r/nba"}, {"text": "[FRESH ALBUM] Drake - Views link People low key selling their chrysler 300s now", "class": "r/hiphopheads"}, {"text": "JAY-Z Discography Now on Spotify https://twitter.com/Spotify/status/1202090253839937536 You have no idea how happy I was to have shuffle into primetime. \n\nI\u2019m going on a fucking jay z bender", "class": "r/hiphopheads"}, {"text": "Tyler, The Creator comes out as gay on his new album The lyrics to [Garden Shed](https://genius.com/Tyler-the-creator-garden-shed-lyrics) are pretty clear along with some lines in [I Ain't Got Time!](https://genius.com/Tyler-the-creator-i-aint-got-time-lyrics)\n\n[Tyler's Twitter two years ago](https://twitter.com/tylerthecreator/status/587459235706900480)\n\n\n**[Mike G of Odd Future weighs in on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MikeGKTA/status/884479926300049409)**\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**/u/KubrickWithFewBricks compiled this list of \"hints Tyler gave us outside his music\":**\n\n[One](https://i.redd.it/b74hugl5gt8z.png)\n\n[Two](https://i.redd.it/uh1xgj6qhs8z.jpg)\n\n[Three](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DEZNU37XgAQ2CwD.jpg) (this was already in the OP but whatev)\n\n[Four](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DEZNtm0XgAAe3EN.jpg)\n\n[Five](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DEZOc5nXoAA4HJp.jpg)\n\n[Six](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DEZRUhOW0AA8E1J.jpg)\n\n[Seven](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DEZUSaFXgAElBNy.jpg)\n\n--\n*[bonus](https://twitter.com/tylerthecreator/status/589078006351564801)* [Feel free to add this to your post](https://twitter.com/MikeGKTA/status/884479926300049409)\n\n/u/KubrickWithFewBricks complied this list of \"hints Tyler gave us outside his music\":\n\n>[1](https://i.redd.it/b74hugl5gt8z.png)\n\n>[2](https://i.redd.it/uh1xgj6qhs8z.jpg)\n\n>[3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DEZNU37XgAQ2CwD.jpg)\n\n>[4](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DEZNtm0XgAAe3EN.jpg)\n\n>[5](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DEZOc5nXoAA4HJp.jpg)\n\n>[6](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DEZRUhOW0AA8E1J.jpg)\n\n>[7](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DEZUSaFXgAElBNy.jpg)\n\n[another one](https://twitter.com/tylerthecreator/status/589078006351564801)", "class": "r/hiphopheads"}, {"text": "Kodak Black sentenced to 3 years and 10 months in federal prison in weapons case. link Still love that this man\u2019s legal name is Bill", "class": "r/hiphopheads"}, {"text": "[FRESH] Kendrick Lamar - DAMN. # Kendrick Lamar - DAMN.\n\n****\n* [**iTunes**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/damn/id1223592280)\n* [**Amazon**](https://www.amazon.com/DAMN-Kendrick-Lamar/dp/B06Y4DGVZC/)\n* [**Tidal**](https://tidal.com/album/72694579)\n* [**Spotify**](https://open.spotify.com/album/4eLPsYPBmXABThSJ821sqY)\n* [**Google Play Music**](https://play.google.com/store/music/album/Kendrick_Lamar_DAMN?id=Bwj4cpxbxjnarequw2jkj5c3a5u)\n\n****\n\n## Initial discussions:\n* **/r/KendrickLamar**\n* **/r/leakthreads**\n\n****\n#### Lyrics (and *zany* theories!) @ [Genius](https://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-damn-tracklist-album-art-lyrics)!\n\n****\n###*Note:*\n\nInitial Discussion thread will be posted 24 hours after the album is first avaliable.

This song samples/remixes Kanye's 'Say You Will'](https://i.imgur.com/Pu6G3DV.jpg)\n\nKanye took this as the opportunity to air out Drake, citing all the sneak disses and behind the scenes threats he's alleged that he's made. In the span of his rants, he's claimed Drake bought out Pusha T's front rows in Toronto to cause a brawl, he sneak dissed him on SICKO MODE, Drake bullies people with mental health issues, only for Drake to end the first rant by calling him.\n\nKanye claimed 'Mission Accomplished' and the sample was not cleared. A couple hours later, Kanye is back and claiming Drake called to threaten his life, where he restated that XXX is dead and 6ix9ine are already in jail, only difference is Kanye is a family man. Kanye says he paved the way for Drake to come up in rap, and he shouldn't be giving the guy with pink polos the tough talk now. Essentially, respect your elders.\n\nAnd then gives a further deep dive into SICKO MODE, calling out Travis for allowing that to come out as a diss to his brother-in-law. Retracts some of the harsher statements which are mirrored below, but then tries to end (as of now?) on a positive note, saying to respect him while he's still here.\n\n---\n\n>[This proves shit faker than wrestling](https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1073319978579955712?s=21)\n\n[mirror](https://i.gyazo.com/596e572ad26c9b82a324df610775c087.png)\n\n>[Still need that apology for mentioning the 350s and trying to take food out your idols kids mouths](https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1073320212806684678)\n\n[mirror](https://i.gyazo.com/fbef670cf79c2719f4dd6bbd42d733be.png)\n\n>[Been trying to meet with you for 6 months bro       You sneak dissing on trav records and texting Kris talking bout how\u2019s the family](https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1073320449088675841)\n\n[mirror](https://i.gyazo.com/9d4c8ed5c3b3018c3ed2a8a36a8007bd.png)\n\n>[I told you I ain\u2019t tell Pusha about your son](https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1073320879705202691)\n\n[mirror](https://i.gyazo.com/f0a96cf0a12341fb8a786b507f24c25e.png)\n\n>[It\u2019s all love bro bro but don\u2019t play with me.

Last night Tony Romo added beautiful color commentary to the Chiefs/Patriots game last night. As a former Quarterback he provided great insight as to what play the other team may or may not run, and why. He even predicted quite a few plays. \n\nWhat we get for nationally televised NBA games during the Conference Finals and NBA finals from Mark Jackson is nothing short of crap. Jackson offers no insight as a former point guard. Instead he spends most of the game poking fun at JVG and talking about absolute nonsense and quite frankly I\u2019m sick of it.

The last game of the regular season was on April 11th. That\u2019s about the same time the voting for the awards took place. Instead of revealing it when they knew the results, they waited until after the playoffs and the draft and had the award show a few days ago. It shoehorned in celebrities and musical acts to push viewership outside of NBA fans to maximize advertising dollars. To make it worse the Coach of the year Award went to a guy who got fired after his team lost in the playoffs. He had to go up and make a speech. I get that it\u2019s a business/financial move because advertisers will pay a ton of money but fans are mad they wait so long to reveal the results solely for the benefit of the NBA. \n\nTL;DR: Awards are good.

Everyone knows James Harden has a particular affinity for the Canadian ballet, aka strip clubs. After the Rocket's dismal performance in Miami last week, and the city's reputation for high quality tit-shacks, I became increasingly curious to see just how much James Harden's vice affects his game.  So here we are, I spent the better part of the week on this, hope y'all enjoy!\n\n**Hypothesis**: James Harden's box score declines in cities with high quality strip clubs\n\n**Test**: Analyze James Harden's performance in every NBA city and correlate with those cities' reputation for strip clubs to see if there is any discernible relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Methodology/Steps**:\n\n* First I extracted all of James Harden's game logs for the past 4 seasons from Basketball Reference, cleaned up the data a bit (a bunch), and appended it into a single worksheet.\n* Next, I filtered out all Home games and all games Harden was inactive or DNP. For the purpose of this analysis we did not look at home games.\n* **Poor Performances** were determined by variances in 6 stats: Points, FG%, 3PT%, FT%, Assists and Turnovers. For each of these stats I compared Harden's *overall* season average to the *city-specific* season average. I identified 2 categories of poor performances:\n\n1. Sub-Par - Harden performed WORSE than season average, and\n2. Very Sub-Par - Harden performed 20%+ WORSE than season average.\n\n* I analyzed his poor performances across each of the NBA\u2019s 28 different cities (did not look at home games so no Houston, there are 2 teams in LA, and I distinguished between Brooklyn and NYC = 28 cities).\n* **City Strip Club Rating** was determined by the average google review rating for the first 10 strip clubs in each city based on the google search \u201c\\[CITY\\] Strip Clubs\u201d (e.g., \u201cDetroit Strip clubs\u201d). Yes, this did involve me making like 30+ searches for strip clubs on my cpu...\n* Finally, I put the City Strip Club Rating into the pivoted game log data, performed a regression analysis and visualized it into charts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\n>!I have proven, to a statistically significant degree, that James Harden\u2019s game performance declines in cities with higher rated strip clubs. !<\n\n>!Correlation Coefficient - r - (between avg strip club rating and total # of sub-par games) = .4575!<\n\n* >!Given the nature of the subject matter, this would be considered a moderate-to-strong correlation. !<\n\n>!Coefficient of Determination - r2 - (between avg strip club rating and total # of sub-par games) = .21!<\n\n* >!This means that James Harden\u2019s box score is 20% predictable based on the quality of a city\u2019s strip clubs !<\n\n>!Other interesting facts: !<\n\n* >!Harden\u2019s best performance comes in city with the worst strip clubs - Toronto!<\n* >!Harden\u2019s worst performance comes in city with the best strip clubs - Miami!<\n* >!Salt Lake city has the 3rd-ranked strip clubs of all NBA cities lol!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Link to all my work](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hwDoaHcXqncb_l24NrxLCWTxE5pLaeKlU8r1Jnp39GQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThe charts won\u2019t upload perfectly to google docs so I have included [screenshots here](https://imgur.com/a/JEhHxkH)\n\n&#x200B;\n\ne. haha well this bl**e**w up.
