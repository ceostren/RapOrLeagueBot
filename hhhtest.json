It doesn't exist because it never happened. You don't get to control someone's emotional response to being called 'that bitch' in front of the entire world. Of course I wanted to like the song. i wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship. He promised to play the song for m, but he never did. While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot 'approve' a song you haven't heard. Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination. I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I never asked to be a part of, since 2009.*\n\nSo first her PR team say there was no phone call, suddenly she never heard a certain part.\n\nAlso here's a better video of the snapchat story, credit /u/Pootrick2: https://flipagram.com/f/sfbgiK4bPf\n\n**Every snapchat vid is Kanye talking to Taylor or vice versa over the phone.**\n\n**Snapchat 1**  \nKanye: Oh ok do, you still got- you still got the Nashville number?  \nTaylor: I do still have the Nashville area code but, I had to change it\n\n**Snapchat 2**  \nKanye: For all my south side niggas that know me best...

It's obviously very tongue in cheek either way\n\n**Snapchat 6**  \nTaylor: I really appreciate you telling me about it!
