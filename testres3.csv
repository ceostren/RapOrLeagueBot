Wow this blew up quick. I'm going to turn off mailbox replies lol.

I'm a Toronto fan so I'll be making a $20 donation to https://www.chla.org/ if Kawhi signs with Toronto. I hope others do the same.

Toronto's Childrens Hospital is Sick Kids Hospital - https://www.sickkids.ca/

I've cross posted this to both /r/torontoraptors and /r/lakers as well to get more eyes on it.

FINAL EDIT: 

So this is a turn of events. Clippers got him. I honestly thought they weren't really in the running anymore and it was a toss up between Lakers and Raptors. As I've said in comments I never meant any disrespect to Clippers fans and congrats to them! When they were brought up I really didn't know how to do a 3 way deal between 2 cities. Now that here here though...

The spirit of the wager was the winning team donates to the other teams kids hospital. Clippes fans have wanted to be in this so much I'm hoping now they step up. I'd suggest donating to either city's kids hospital. You want to keep your donation local give to CHLA, want to show Toronto some love give to Sick Kids in Toronto. for Lakes and Raptors fans I'm suggesting they each give to the other charity. As a Raptors fan I'm still going to give to CHLA. There is no reason not to in my mind.

I'm glad my post could bring people together in a positive way and I know some good has come out of it.

r/nba,"Bad officiating calls in Warriors-Rockets G7 Strap in boys, it's gonna be a ride. So I've basically reviewed the whole game last night, and here are the questionable plays which I thought should have been calls/were called wrongly.

#Calls going against Rockets:

1. [Wrong travelling call against Capela](https://streamable.com/cso98), didn't lift up his pivot foot.

2. [Slight push on PJ Tucker no call, KD gets the call on the other end](https://streamable.com/boqtv). Probably a superstar call.

3. [Harden might have gotten shoved in the back by Looney](https://streamable.com/7189z), no call.

4. [Capela called for a goaltend for what seemed to be a clean block](https://streamable.com/qtz8u).

5. [Harden fouled on the landing](https://streamable.com/4d9r6), no call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/s06jh)

6. [Harden fouled on three attempt](https://streamable.com/bzjys), no call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/alpcm)

7. [Ref disallows continuation on Harden's three](https://streamable.com/vhads). [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/lydp2)

8. [Eric Gordon fouled by Draymond](https://streamable.com/zynw6), no call.

#Calls going against Warriors:

1. [Klay gets called for an early 2nd foul which didn't look like much contact](https://streamable.com/e0s94), looked like ball just slipped out of EG's hands.

2. [Curry's hip gets pushed by Gerald Green](https://streamable.com/o4nk6), even falls on the ground. No call.

3. [Jordan Bell raked across the arm by Harden](https://streamable.com/s2n6m), no call. (pro tip: right click and select 1/4 speed to see the contact)

4. [Klay gets hand checked by Tucker and loses the ball](https://streamable.com/pqylu). No call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/j8f9c)

5. [KD gets pushed into Harden by Ryan Anderson](https://streamable.com/n27zm), foul on KD. Similar to [this play](https://streamable.com/nhcep), albeit less egregious by Anderson.

6. [Klay gets a point removed by Scott Foster](https://streamable.com/0nhtk).

A major theme which showed itself was the fact that Ryan Anderson literally (I'm not kidding) hand checked Curry every time he was switched onto him. And the Warriors forced that switch A LOT. Here's ALL the plays where Anderson guarded Curry:

r/nba,"Why LeBron would sign with every NBA team **Atlanta Hawks**

LeBron is secretly a huge Twister fan. He will join the Hawks so he can film Twister 2 with their owner’s wife on their off days.

**Boston Celtics**

LeBron misses Kyrie. He wants to play basketball with his friend and that means playing for the Celtics.

OR

LeBron wants to troll Kyrie. He will go to Boston management and ask them to trade Kyrie back to Cleveland if they want him to join. Danny Ainge will agree because he has no heart.

**Brooklyn Nets**

LeBron loves NY. He will go to New York to sign with the Knicks to play in historic Madison Square Garden. However, during the drive to the stadium, his driver makes a wrong turn and they end up in Brooklyn. LeBron realizes the mistake, but shrugs his shoulders and signs with the Nets instead, because he will have the same results with either the Knicks or Nets.


**Charlotte Hornets**

LeBron wants to prove he’s better than Michael Jordan. He will sign with the Hornets to taunt MJ directly. He will win the Finals in 2019 with the Hornets and won’t let MJ touch the trophy. After the season, LeBron will buy out MJ’s shares and he will become majority owner. He will then trade himself to a better team because Dwight is too annoying and nobody will agree to LeBron’s trade proposals involving Dwight.

**Chicago Bulls**

LeBron wants to prove he’s better than Michael Jordan. He will sign with the Bulls so he can win 7 championships to pass what MJ did.


**Cleveland Cavaliers**

LeBron loves Cleveland as much as he hates moving. LeBron will re-sign with the Cavs, because it’s more convenient than moving to a different city.

**Dallas Mavericks**

LeBron is still haunted by the 2011 Finals. He will go to Dallas to learn from the true GOAT Dirk Nowitzki. There, LeBron will lead the Mavs all the way to the number 1 seed in the West, only to lose to the Warriors in the first round after KD leaves for India to re-join his snek charmer friend.

**Denver Nuggets**

LeBron loves chicken nuggets. He will sign with Denver, only to be disappointed. He then will retire and start his own chicken nugget company.

**Detroit Pistons**

LeBron will become the new Pistons President of Basketball Operations. His first act in his new role will be to sign himself as the head coach/starting SF. His second transaction will be to trade Blake Griffin to the Cavs for the 8th pick in the draft and salary filler, because LeBron will blackmail Dan Gilbert into doing it.

**Golden State Warriors**

LeBron wants all the ringz. He will sign with the Warriors for the veteran minimum so he can win not 1, not 2, not 3, not 4, not 5, not 6, not 7, not 8, not 9, but 10 championships.

**Houston Rockets**

LeBron loves space. He will sign with the Rockets so he can go to NASA and fly an actual rocket into space to find better competition on other planets. Mike Dan Tony will be confused why LeBron doesn’t show up to their games. Mike, he’s in space, deal with it.

**Indiana Pacers**

LeBron loves pace. He will sign with the Pacers so he can out-pace the other NBA players and win a championship. He will also become best friends with Lance Stephenson and the two will call out plays to each other by blowing in each other’s rear, I mean ear.

**LA Clippers**

LeBron wants to live in Hollywood, but doesn’t want to be under the shadow of Laker greats. If he can just lead the Clippers to the conference finals, they would rename their franchise LeBron’s Clippers.

**LA Lakers**

LeBron wants to live in Hollywood, but doesn’t want to be under the shadow of Clipper goods. He also wants to learn from the great Lavar Ball on how to play basketball as good as him.

**Memphis Grizzlies**

LeBron will not sign with the Memphis Grizzlies.

**Miami Heat**

LeBron will go back to Miami because he left his white headband there and wants it back.

**Milwaukee Bucks**

LeBron loves freaks. He will join the Greek Freak and sign with the Bucks. Then they will sign Rick James to preform every halftime so he can sing LeBron’s favorite song “Super Freak”

**Minnesota Timberwolves**

LeBron wants to learn from former MVP Derrick Rose. He also wants to torture his body and allow Coach Thibs to play him all 48 minutes for all 82 games.

**New Orleans Pelicans**

LeBron loves smoothies. He will join the Brow and sign with the Pelicans, so he can get unlimited smoothies at the Smoothie King Center.

**New York Knicks**

LeBron loves NY. He will go to New York to sign with the Knicks to play in historic Madison Square Garden. During the drive to the stadium, his driver makes the correct turn and they end up in MSG. LeBron realizes this and signs with the Knicks.

**OKC Thunder**

LeBron will sign with the Thunder so he can play with Russell Westbrook for one season, then leave after that and become an even better player.

**Orlando Magic**

LeBron will take his talents to Central Florida. He will sign with the Magic and lead them to another Finals lost.

**Philadelphia 76ers**

LeBron will sign with the 76ers because he trusts the process. LeBron will single handedly play bad for 3 seasons and tank so that the 76ers will get more draft picks to add to their squad. Then by age 37, LeBron will have what he needs to win another Eastern Conference Finals.

**Phoenix Suns**

LeBron loves hot-related teams. He will sign with the Suns and win 2 championships to prove to Pat Riley that he isn’t so special with his so called “Heat” for the “Suns” are the hottest thing in the universe.

**Portland Trail Blazers**

LeBron loves Nike. He will sign with the Blazers so that he can spend his off days at Nike headquarters creating new shoes.

**Sacramento Kings**

LeBron is the King. He will sign with the Kings, because that’s where he belongs.

**San Antonio Spurs**

LeBron loves Coach Pop. He will sign with the Spurs to learn from him, only to find out Coach Pop actually has no idea what he’s doing and is just really lucky. LeBron will use that luck to convince Kawhy? To stay and they will win a championship every other year in 2019, 2021, and 2023.

**Toronto Raptors**

LeBron will sign with the Raptors just to check up on them and make sure they are ok.

**Utah Jazz**

LeBron loves jazz. He will sign with Utah only to find out they don’t actually have jazz. He will then force a trade to New Orleans to be close to real jazz and because he remembered that he loves smoothies.

**Washington Wizards**

LeBron loves politics. He will sign with the Wizards so he can play basketball and also become the next president of the United States in 2020.



**EDIT**

Some of you have been asking for this, so here you go...

**Seattle Supersonics**

LeBron won't sign with this team because it doesn't exist. >doesn’t want to be under the shadow of Laker greats

As some of y’all know, my name is brandUn DeShay. I produced a lot of songs over the years but the ones we’re talking about today are “School High” & “Last Cypher”.

It's been almost 2 MONTHS since I heard from Joey Bada$$ yall....
I wanna give him the benefit of the doubt that he's a much busier man than me these days, but I've also reached out to his label management over the last 5 months and still no reply.

These beats I produced for Joey were done when I was 2 or 3 yrs in and for years these songs remained FREE mixtape downloads and I had no problem with that. I never asked for bread because technically no one was getting paid.

Until recently (December 12/23/18) Joey re-released the PEEP the Aprocalypse mixtape on all streaming platforms. Therefore generating bread off streams and DID NOT ask my permission, did not do splits or even work out a deal to just buy my share of the publishing from me.

To me, if you making money off the work/effort of another man, make sure that man eating too 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️

And I hate takin shit like this public cuz usually i think that shit is corny asf... butttt I'm still tryna avoid taking this to court to retrieve the 💰. 

I hope Joey reaches back so we can figure this out... the ""producer x rapper"" relationship in Hip-Hop deserves some success stories.

Please retweet or share if this resonates at all. 




 I wanna add one more thing. 

This EXACT situation happened with me and Mac Miller before he passed (RIP to malcom cuz he was an angel).

Mac wanted to re-release his mixtape “Macadelic” for free and you know what he did? 

He contacted me first about “Aliens Fighting Robots” and sent me paperwork!!!
We agreed on a price, permissions, splits and that was it. Everyone went home happy and you can now stream Macadelic on Spotify rn.

EDIT: 

not to sound condescending but i'm just gonna add a couple of discussion questions here incase y'all get tired of 'father stretch my anus' jokes and lyric chains:

What direction do you think ~~this album is~~ these albums are going to take? What direction would you like to see them take? Do you think the length of the album is good or bad? What influences are we supposed to see on the album? Do you think he's gonna release it in time?


We know he's let Charlamagne hear some of it, and I believe Nas reportedly was working on something with Kanye too, what do you think it is? 

edit 2: 

why didn't kanye tweet the name of his own album? I'm assuming the second one is Kids See Ghost - Kids See Ghost

Why is ghost singular? do you expect both the drop? which one do you think will sell more?

r/hiphopheads,"This pill popping culture needs to end now. We don’t need to Loose anybody else. link I've been on a path to educate people on benzodiazepine (Xanax, Klonopin, Valium, etc) withdrawals IRL and on the internet. **I really hope this post gets some attention because the info is important.**


**Benzos and alcohol are the only two classes of drugs that can kill you when withdrawing from them.**


I'll try to keep it simple. Benzos (and alcohol) work by making a neurotransmitter, GABA, more effective when it binds to the brain. GABA basically reduces how strong/powerful nerve impulses are, so when you're anxious and on edge, these drugs will sedate and chill you out by reducing the excitability of the brain cells associated with anxiety, muscle stiffness, etc.


When you take both drugs for a long time and suddenly stop, you start with rebound anxiety. Your neurons start going into hyperactive mode because the GABA is less effective after you artificially strengthened them by taking Xanax and drinking a lot. A few days later, your brain starts going really hyperactive and you can experience things like delirium tremens, seizures, and die. **It's long suspected that rappers like Lil Wayne and G Herbo have had seizures due to benzo dependence.**


What's worse? Benzos can cause post acute withdrawal symptoms that can start days or weeks after your last dose. You think you're fine and recovered until you start experiencing awful symptoms of anxiety, panic, tetany, and even seizures depending on how much you were dosing and how often. **I know from personal experience with friends who are still struggling with withdrawal issues 2 years after quitting.**


**Xanax is not cool. Percocets are not cool.** They are big pharma literally making you dependent on them for life for $$$. No matter how much of a badass you think you are, you are absolutely fucked if you take these drugs for a long period of time. 


If you are taking more than 4 mg of Xanax, 4 mg of Klonopin, or 40 mg of Valium a day, you can die if you miss your doses. **PLEASE GET HELP NOW**. Seriously, do not quit cold turkey. You need a professional to help you taper and when you do go get help, mention something known as the **Ashton Manual created by Dr. Heather Ashton**. It will limit your chance of seizing and dying by titrating your dose down.


There's a ton more info I can provide on this topic through my years of drug education and research. Please PM me if you need help. I'm very cognizant of drugs I put in my body and I whole heartedly believe that benzos are the next major epidemic for our generation and that the effects of this class of drugs are going to lead to way more issues than the opiate epidemic we have right now.


&nbsp;

&nbsp;




**EDIT: I see this post is blowing up so I want to clarify a few things!**


**1)** I'm not a licensed medical professional. I am an engineer with a lot of self-taught knowledge on psychology, neurology, and biochemistry. **The number 1 piece of advice for anyone who feels like they are in a serious situation is to go to a doctor. Check yourself into an inpatient ER if you need to. But make sure you discuss that you are fearing seizures/withdrawals and you need to be checked in and monitored**.


**2)** I did not mean to downplay the severity of opiate withdrawals. There have been a few documented cases of opiate withdrawal related seizures and deaths. It is just far more likely to occur when withdrawing from GABAergic drugs. This means that sleeping pills, RC benzo/thienodiazepines (like Etizolam), GHB/GBL, barbiturates can all manifest themselves into benzo withdrawal symptoms. Please get help if you think you need it!


**3)** I'm going to put together a list of resources and supplements in a document so I can post it here later. Please do not use it as medical literature, but it is there to help those of you who are really struggling at least cope a bit better. 


**4)** I know about fake presses, fent getting into pills, etc. I also understand Peep had a polydrug overdose. However, that doesn't take away from the fact that both drugs he took can be lethal by themselves. It also emphasizes the importance of not buying fake presses online and for harm reduction purposes, trying a small amount before dosing large quantities of pills.


**5)** While I put together my resources, here are a few pointers that are quick wins:

a) CBD and Magnesium supplements helped me quite a bit. Everyone can be different but there is sound research out there supporting this. Calcium deficiencies may also cause some of your symptoms. The best idea is to get some lab work done to see if you are deficient.

b) Do not go cold turkey if you're on any dose of benzos. Talk to your doctor before making any decision to stop taking your drugs.

c) Beta blockers do a good job of stopping physical anxiety symptoms. They are also not habit forming and not addictive. Talk to your doctor about this.



**REMEMBER: You all matter and deserve to break free from your demons. You're not alone in your battles and if you're struggling, know that you have amazing people ready to listen and support you even if it doesn't seem like it. Please find good providers who listen to you and use medical intervention when necessary. I've been getting tons of messages and trying to get back to all of them but if I miss yours, please don't feel bad! I'm extremely busy with life right now so I may not get to everything right away. Cheers people and stay safe :)**

He drank whiskey at major lazer after-party is til 4 am.. went back to festival at midday .. played piano like Mozart with the sun blazing down on him.. throw up on stage . Cry a bit, rap some more then pass out in the grass and text me a few hours like where we going next .. next five years I see this guy everywhere .. best people I could always count on.. we made a lot of music in my first studio in Burbank.. he kept getting better and better .. this dude lived so hard was so amazing and talented and still extremely missunderstood.. another video is me and @skrillex on New year's Eve at MSG and Mac just came out at midnight like he was he headliner in his Riddler suit. Fuck I couldn't stop laughing .. he was always there in the middle of the best moments .. and if there wasn't a vibe he created it and made the room brighter .. he radiated positivity, but there wasn't a balance.. the other side was he was deeply insecure and always found substitution for what was missing in his life .. For a second think about the people around you and make sure they are always aware of the love .. don't take a second forgranted. They might need you and you don't even notice it because your too busy .. always gonna love you Mac""](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bncn-NpgdZL/?hl=en&taken-by=diplo)
