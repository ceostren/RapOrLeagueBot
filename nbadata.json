Not to mention the fact that everything they were saying was being blasted throughout the entire venue. \n\nFirst off, there were over a dozen teams in attendance last night. The only one that they chose to talk about: the Knicks. They talked unbelievably liberally about Zion going to NY, as if they had already won it. However, as I doubt any of them realized, the Knicks had the same chance of obtaining the #1 pick as the Cavs and the Suns, the latter of which I don\u2019t even think was mentioned once on the broadcast.\n\nThen, there was Zion. Rachel Nichols kept referring to the #1 pick as \u201cwho gets Zion.\u201d Every time she said that or mentioned the kid, the camera would cut to the embarrassed 18 y/o who was just there to see what team picks where. There is no guarantee that Zion will go #1 overall. It is very very likely, but not guaranteed. Not to mention that they did this in front of a large number of draft prospects in attendance. What does all of this coverage and press mean to them if it\u2019s only going to Zion?\n\nAnd finally, the Pelicans. Woj made every team\u2019s case for a possible AD trade that night. Whenever a team with chances of getting a top 10 pick was mentioned, Woj had to slip in that they may be looking to use that pick as an \u201casset\u201d to trade for AD. I\u2019m honestly very happy the Pelicans won because the disrespect they were receiving the whole night was greatly trumped when they won the first pick.\n\nNow I get all of these things are said ten times over on any other sports news broadcast. However, as I said, Rachel Nichols audio was blasted for everyone at the event to hear, including the draft prospects and team representatives. After watching this, I asked my dad if there was ever a time where the media would be able to speak this liberally about sports in front of all of those people. He said \u201cno.\u201d\n\nEDIT: Apparently, there are rumors circulating that Rachel Nichols was drunk.

Everyone knows James Harden has a particular affinity for the Canadian ballet, aka strip clubs. After the Rocket's dismal performance in Miami last week, and the city's reputation for high quality tit-shacks, I became increasingly curious to see just how much James Harden's vice affects his game.  So here we are, I spent the better part of the week on this, hope y'all enjoy!\n\n**Hypothesis**: James Harden's box score declines in cities with high quality strip clubs\n\n**Test**: Analyze James Harden's performance in every NBA city and correlate with those cities' reputation for strip clubs to see if there is any discernible relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Methodology/Steps**:\n\n* First I extracted all of James Harden's game logs for the past 4 seasons from Basketball Reference, cleaned up the data a bit (a bunch), and appended it into a single worksheet.\n* Next, I filtered out all Home games and all games Harden was inactive or DNP. For the purpose of this analysis we did not look at home games.\n* **Poor Performances** were determined by variances in 6 stats: Points, FG%, 3PT%, FT%, Assists and Turnovers. For each of these stats I compared Harden's *overall* season average to the *city-specific* season average. I identified 2 categories of poor performances:\n\n1. Sub-Par - Harden performed WORSE than season average, and\n2. Very Sub-Par - Harden performed 20%+ WORSE than season average.\n\n* I analyzed his poor performances across each of the NBA\u2019s 28 different cities (did not look at home games so no Houston, there are 2 teams in LA, and I distinguished between Brooklyn and NYC = 28 cities).\n* **City Strip Club Rating** was determined by the average google review rating for the first 10 strip clubs in each city based on the google search \u201c\\[CITY\\] Strip Clubs\u201d (e.g., \u201cDetroit Strip clubs\u201d). Yes, this did involve me making like 30+ searches for strip clubs on my cpu...\n* Finally, I put the City Strip Club Rating into the pivoted game log data, performed a regression analysis and visualized it into charts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\n>!I have proven, to a statistically significant degree, that James Harden\u2019s game performance declines in cities with higher rated strip clubs. !<\n\n>!Correlation Coefficient - r - (between avg strip club rating and total # of sub-par games) = .4575!<\n\n* >!Given the nature of the subject matter, this would be considered a moderate-to-strong correlation. !<\n\n>!Coefficient of Determination - r2 - (between avg strip club rating and total # of sub-par games) = .21!<\n\n* >!This means that James Harden\u2019s box score is 20% predictable based on the quality of a city\u2019s strip clubs !<\n\n>!Other interesting facts: !<\n\n* >!Harden\u2019s best performance comes in city with the worst strip clubs - Toronto!<\n* >!Harden\u2019s worst performance comes in city with the best strip clubs - Miami!<\n* >!Salt Lake city has the 3rd-ranked strip clubs of all NBA cities lol!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Link to all my work](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hwDoaHcXqncb_l24NrxLCWTxE5pLaeKlU8r1Jnp39GQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThe charts won\u2019t upload perfectly to google docs so I have included [screenshots here](https://imgur.com/a/JEhHxkH)\n\n&#x200B;\n\ne. haha well this bl**e**w up.

They're the second oldest of those 6 teams behind the Clippers.\n\n* They've only drafted 4 All-Stars that went on to play for them despite being around since 1988: Alonzo Mourning, Larry Johnson, Baron Davis, and Kemba Walker. And they've had the most chances to draft All-Stars too: the Hornets rank #1 with the lowest average draft spot in that time.\n\n* Then-coach Steve Clifford wanted the Hornets to draft Donovan Mitchell in 2017, but Rich Cho overruled him and drafted Malik Monk instead.\n\n* The Hornets were seriously looking to draft Pascal Siakam in 2016, but decided to trade their pick for Marco Belinelli who spent one year with the team before being traded to Atlanta in the Dwight Howard trade.\n\n* The Hornets were offered three first-round picks by the Celtics for the #9 pick in 2015. Michael Jordan turned the offer down to pick Frank Kaminsky. Kaminsky was always in the coach's doghouse here, his family hated Charlotte, and Kaminsky signed with Phoenix this offseason.\n\n* After having the worst record in NBA history in 2012, the Bobcats lost out on the #1 pick which was going to be Anthony Davis. They then selected Michael Kidd-Gilchrist with the #2 pick instead of Bradley Beal. In the same draft, they selected Jeffery Taylor with their 2nd round pick, just ahead of Draymond Green and Khris Middleton.\n\n* They did select Kemba Walker in 2011, but they also gave Stephen Jackson, Shaun Livingston, and the pick that would turn into Tobias Harris so they could jump up and draft Bismack Biyombo. They selected Biyombo instead of the player that had been mocked to them in several mock drafts: Kawhi Leonard. They also had Klay Thompson on the board.\n\n* The second best draft pick they've had since their 2004 rebirth has been Emeka Okafor.\n\n* They haven't won a playoff series since April 2002 when LeBron was in high school, Zion was 1 year old, The Scorpion King was #1 at the box office, Ashanti had the #1 song in America, and Hollywood Hogan was WWE Champion. The closest they've come to winning a series since then was the Purple Shirt Guy game when they were up 3-2 vs. the Heat and had cut a 9 point Heat lead to 2 with 1:30 left. A Hornets fan known as Purple Shirt Guy started inexplicably jawing with Dwyane Wade who proceeded to drop a quick 5 points to tie the series up. The Hornets would go on to lose Game 7 in Miami by 27 points.\n\n* Despite letting their best player ever walk for nothing, they're hard-capped at the moment. They'll be hard-capped this season with a starting 5 of Terry Rozier, Cody Zeller, Nic Batum, Dwayne Bacon, and Miles Bridges. Bismack Biyombo will be making $17 million off the bench, Marvin Williams will be making $15 million off the bench, and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist will be making $13 million off the bench. Nic Batum (who has turned into a completely worthless player) will be entering the 4th year of a 5 year deal (final year a player option) that will pay him $25.5 million. He'll almost certainly use that player option in 2020 and will be making $27.1 million.\n\n* The Hornets hired a new radio play-by-play guy before the start of the 2018-19 season that grew up a Hornets fan and was a beloved radio host in Charlotte. He was fired in the middle of a week in March with no explanation and no explanation has come out since.\n\n* Michael Jordan hasn't given an interview where he's discussed the Hornets in any detail (besides Kemba Walker) since 2014.\n\nSo as you bitch and complain about how your team hasn't done anything in a long time or how you only have one All-Star and you're disappointed you didn't get another, remember that things could always be worse.

Instead of revealing it when they knew the results, they waited until after the playoffs and the draft and had the award show a few days ago.

Then they kept me on hold for over 40 minutes outside the venue.  I missed the game and it could happen to you.**\n_______________\n\nLet me preface this by saying I do not blame the Kings or NBA for this situation, however I do think that they need to be aware of what one of their major resellers is doing to their fans.\n\nI am a Sacramento Kings fan - through thick and thin.  I scream about hating them, complain, and bemoan our lack of defense, lack of wins, lack of\u2026 everything.  We don\u2019t have much.  We haven\u2019t been to the playoffs in 10 years \u2013 the second longest drought in the NBA (behind the Wolves who I guarantee break that streak soon).  We have a superstar who teases us with his brilliance and then punishes us with his attitude and demeanor.  We went through an absolute nightmare of an ownership that tried not once, not twice, but three times to steal our team and take them to another city.  We just celebrated breaking thirty wins for the first time in nine years.  Yet I love the team to the core.\n\nI\u2019ve watched this team since I was a kid.  In the fourth grade, I had a Kings ruler with pictures of Danny Ainge, Wayman Tisdale, and Kenny Smith.  I had, and still have, only seen NBA games in a structure that has all of the sex appeal of a giant flat office building \u2013 Sleep Train Arena (it will always be ARCO to me).  \n\nThe entire basketball nation probably knows the plight of our dilapidated arena \u2013 tarps falling from the ceiling, leaks when it rains, toilets that don\u2019t work.  Yet we Kings fans love the place.  We always have.  It\u2019s the only real arena we have ever had \u2013 we don\u2019t have any other major league sports in our city and this place is just cozy and fits us.  \n\nIt is the perfect arena for a bunch of rabid fans in a city that Phil Jackson infamously called a \u201ccow town\u201d \u2013 unwittingly unleashing the birth of the very loud Kings cowbells.\n\nAfter all of the disasters of the previous ownership group, we finally were blessed by a man willing to save our team \u2013 Vivek Ranadive.  While we can argue his basketball knowledge and his hands on approach to basketball operations, we cannot argue that he saved the Sacramento Kings and ponied up a lot of money to build us a brand new arena in downtown Sacramento.\n\nWith that very arena scheduled to open this October, many of us Kings fans circled April 9, 2016 on our calendar; the final game at the \u201cold barn\u201d after 28 years.\n\nI was one of those people.  I frequently purchase my tickets from a variety of sources \u2013 Kings.com, eBay, StubHub, Craigslist, etc.  Where ever the best deal lies.  Some are obviously more risky than others \u2013 Craigslist comes to mind.  \n\nI would not fret about buying tickets from StubHub \u2013 I\u2019ve done it before plenty of times.  I hear their commercials all of the time on the radio.  I had no reason to believe that there was any risk buying tickets from their website.\n\nUnfortunately, I found out that I was completely wrong last night.\n \nYesterday, I bought tickets to the final game at Sleep Train with a scheduled tip off against the OKC Thunder at 7:30 pm.  I looked through StubHub and found a great dead for two tickets for my wife and I in Row H of the lower bowl.  The total price was $356.00 \u2013 expensive for a meaningless basketball game, but not for a once-in-a-lifetime event.  \n\nThe Kings were going to do it up big; tons of free giveaways, meet and greets with former players that spanned the entire Sacramento era, the opportunity to go out on the court and shoot a free throw and take pictures \u2013 it was going to be an amazing close to our shabby, but loved, arena.\n\nI [purchased the tickets a little after 5:00 pm yesterday from StubHub](https://imgur.com/COW0Khe).  At 5:22 pm, I received my email confirmation with the tickets.  I immediately took [screenshots](http://imgur.com/22fIc9n) of [both tickets](https://imgur.com/gvpW9B0) to scan at the door on my phone.  My wife and I got ready and we were on our way to drive the 30 or so miles to the arena.\n\nWe arrived at approximately 7:00 pm and by this point could see all of the news trucks, concession stands, and hear the music playing.  We were getting excited.  The parking lot was as full as I\u2019ve ever seen it.\n\nWe made our way past the security check point and walked up to the self-scanner at the door where I pulled up the screenshots of my tickets.  I scanned the first one at the turnstyle:  REFUND flashed on the screen.  I stood there for a second thinking maybe it didn\u2019t register so I tried again.  REFUND.\n\nAt this point, people were piling up behind me so I stepped aside feeling a little embarrassed \u2013 like I was some scammer or didn\u2019t know how to use the scanner.  This was where I felt my first pang of panic.  \n\nI pulled up the second ticket and slid back in line to try again.  REFUND.  I flagged down a door attendant who tried his hand scanner on both tickets: REFUND, REFUND.  It was 7:05 pm and I was in full on panic mode now.  \n\nThe door attendant advised me to go to the box office so we tore off in that direction. I desperately did not want to miss the last ever player introductions at this arena.  Inside the box office, I was sympathetically told by the attendant, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, this is a StubHub problem and we can\u2019t help you \u2013 you need to call them but they\u2019re very good at refunds.\u201d\n\nREFUND.  There\u2019s that word again.  \n\nI don\u2019t want a refund \u2013 I want to see this game!  And time is tick, tick, ticking away.  I grab my phone and literally type StubHub into google as fast as my fingers will let me.  I find the number and call.  After the automated message, the voice tells me the first thing I was dreading to hear, \u201call of our representatives are assisting other callers \u2013 we will be with you shortly.\u201d\n\nI am basically beside myself by now \u2013 I am down to about 15 minutes to tip off and I have no way through the door.  At 7:25pm, while still on hold, I got desperate and went back to the box office.  I asked the representative what the cheapest tickets were just to get in the building.  He tells me $160.00 each for nosebleed upper bowl tickets \u2013 plus fees.  \n\nI can\u2019t believe what I am hearing.  I still don\u2019t know the status of my StubHub tickets so now I am faced with the choice of buying these tickets in front of me for more than the lower bowl tickets that I should already have in my possession or continuing to wait on hold.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I am getting a refund or not for the StubHub tickets, since no one will answer the phone, and am afraid of buying four tickets.  The box office rep says to me, \u201cman, I\u2019m so sorry \u2013 we\u2019ve been seeing this all night from StubHub.\u201d\n\n7:25 pm, 7:30 pm, 7:40 pm, 7:45 pm\n\nBy 7:45 pm, I came to the realization that I was not going to see this game.  My wife and I started the most depressing, dejected walk back to our car imaginable.  About halfway there, the StubHub rep finally came on the line \u2013 after 40+ minutes on hold.  I calmly (as possible) explained my situation to him and asked him exactly what had happened.\n\nHe was unable to explain why my tickets would not work.  I asked him point blank, \u201cDid the guy who sold me these tickets also sell them to someone else.\u201d  He would not answer, just saying that sometimes there are issues with the tickets.  I kept pressing him, asking him why I was not notified that my tickets would not work before I got to the door.  At least then I would have had an opportunity to get different ones.  [The only email I received at that point was my confirmation](https://imgur.com/si3xBbk).  He told me that they do not monitor the transactions so if there is an issue, you will not know until you get denied at the door.\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe that I was not getting an answer as to why my tickets would not work.  I explained to him that this was not just any game \u2013 this is a one-time event.  I could tell that he was starting to understand the gravity of my situation.  I kept pushing him about the seller and how this happened.  That\u2019s when he dropped the bomb on me.\n\nHe said, and I quote, **\u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t tell you this, but the seller you bought these tickets from is already under investigation for selling bad tickets.\u201d**\n\nSo there it is \u2013 StubHub knew that this guy is selling bad tickets on their site.  Or at the very least, he is selling the same tickets to multiple people.  The rep told me that he would be investigated which mean absolutely nothing to me standing in the parking lot.  \n\nHe told me he would issue a refund for the price of the tickets and offered me 20% off of my next purchase.  It wasn\u2019t then, and it\u2019s not now, about the money.  We missed something that we had our heart set on.\n\nWe went to a nearby restaurant and watched the game on TV which honestly felt more painful.  It was basically everything we knew it would be; a great halftime show featuring the past players, sentimental videos, the roar of the sell-out crowd as the game came down to the final shot \u2013 with the Kings winning it with 1 second on the clock.  But it wasn\u2019t about the game on the court, it was about the atmosphere in the building.  And we missed it.\n\nThe final kick in the teeth came on the drive home as I listened to the post-game on AM radio.  During a commercial break there was a StubHub ad talking about their \u201cguarantee\u201d to get you in the game.  I couldn\u2019t believe it.  \n\nAs soon as I got home, I fired off an email to StubHub explaining what happened [PART 1](https://imgur.com/CsPS7id) and [PART 2](https://imgur.com/xhxoupa).  This morning, [I got the response which was basically a form letter](https://imgur.com/05E42wK) with some things changed in it.  They ask me to call them back so that they can further investigate.  I called them and the rep I spoke to had no idea why I was calling in, saying, \u201coh they already are looking into the seller.  They probably just wanted you to call to verify you received your refund.\u201d  I knew I got my refund last night!  \n\nI asked him if he at least saw the 20% discount on my account for my next purchase and he said, \u201cNo I don\u2019t see it but I will make sure I add it right now.  It\u2019s actually a 20% credit based on the purchase price of the tickets you already bought.\u201d  At this point, whatever.  So he tells me based on the price of $356.00, my credit on my account will be $71.20.  Not nearly what I think I should get for what I missed but I know I\u2019m not going to get anywhere with this guy.  He thanks me for using StubHub (!) and the call ends.\n\nA couple of minutes later, [an email comes through showing the credit issued to my account](https://imgur.com/Wjryil1).  $17.80.  Only missed the mark by $53.   At this point, I am at a loss for words.  \n\nI have sent off yet another email re-explaining everything and asking the questions:\n\n* Why does the seller retain control over tickets that he sold and [received money for](https://imgur.com/AlpkvTh)?\n\n* Why does StubHub not warn it\u2019s buyers that you will not make it in to your event if the seller chooses to take his tickets back and resell them to someone else?\n\n* Why was I never advised before I made it to the gate that I was not going to get in?  Had I been advised with enough time, I could have received my refund and still bought other tickets.  By the time I found out I wasn\u2019t getting in and then waited on hold for 40 minutes, I missed my chance to get in.\n\n- Why was the offer of equal or better seats never given to me at the time?  I would have been mad at missing the first quarter, but at least I would have seen the final three quarters.\n\n* Why is there not some sort of seller feedback system to warn buyers of fraudulent sellers similar to eBay?  By their own representative\u2019s admission, this seller was known to StubHub to be a potentially fraudulent seller.  Had I known this guy had issues, I obviously would have avoided the listing.\n\nHere is StubHub\u2019s guarantee [straight from their website](http://www.stubhub.com/fanprotect-update/):\n\n**Summary of StubHub guarantee to Buyers:**\n\n* *You will get your tickets in time for the event*\n\n* *Your tickets will be valid for entry*\n\n* *Your tickets will be the same as those you ordered*\n\n*If any of these things do not occur and you comply with applicable policies and timelines, we will find you comparable or better tickets to the event, or offer you a refund or FanCode for future purchase*\n\n\nI was never, at any point last night, offered comparable or better tickets.  Even though at that point, I would have been mad as I had already missed the first quarter.\n\n\nI apologize for the exceptionally long post.  I want to warn people about StubHub and tell everyone that this company is no better than buying from some stranger on Craigslist.  I hope this gains some traction so that no one else has to go through something as bad as this. I'm so sorry man. I myself intentionally didn't buy tickets for this game because I've heard stories in the past about how bad they are when it's a desirable game (so I only use them for random, non-important games), and I absolutely regretted not trying to get some tickets last night when I watched it on TV. \n\nAs a Kings fan of so many years, I would be absolutely devastated. I grew up with them, and I was kicking myself last night for not watching them leave Arco in person. I know it's not about the money. It's about not being able to say goodbye to your childhood home.\n\nI'm sorry that it happened to you.", "class": "r/nba"}, {"text": "Lonzo Ball released more songs on spotify (21), than he made free throws last season (20).

People are calling for a lifetime ban and demanding that he be forced to sell his shares in the team. The incident is already written on his Wikipedia page.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPeople are out for blood with Kyle Lowry leading the charge.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>\"A guy like that, showing his true class, and he shouldn't be a part of our league.

The same Kyle Lowry who in 2012 pled guilty to the battery of a female referee at a charity basketball game. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis was one of his quotes on that day:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>\"B****, meet me outside. I will kick your a**!\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHe then proceeded to throw a basketball at her for a second time, as hard as he could. He (potentially) received a fine of up to $1,000 and was suspended for 0 games. 500 times less than Mark Stevens got for his push. The fine was from a judge in a courtroom and not even from the league. The league did nothing. There is no mention of this on Lowry's wikipedia page. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf Lowry thinks $500,000 and a year ban is soft for Mark Stevens then I wonder what he thought about his $0, 0 game punishment for battery of a woman in 2012?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn August of 2010, beloved NBA clown Lance Stephenson pushed his pregnant girlfriend down a staircase and then proceeded to bash her head against the stairs. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nTwo years prior to this he sexually assaulted a 17 year old girl at his high school.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHe went on to play over 500 NBA games and earn over $35 million dollars. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt the time of the staircase attack, he hadn't played a single NBA game. 9 years later, he's still in the league. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI was a fan of Lance but only because I'd never heard this mentioned in a single one of his games. I even paid actual money to buy his Charlotte Hornets jersey. I wore his name and number on my back. Call me old fashioned, but I think that the second you bash your pregnant girlfriend's head against some stairs, you should forfeit the privilege of playing NBA basketball.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOJ Mayo and Tyreke Evans were both given 2 year bans for violating the NBA anti-drug program. The NBA is prohibited from disclosing what type of drugs they were found to have taken but reports suggest the violations were related to \"drugs of abuse\" which implies they were recreational and not performance enhancing.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nJason Kidd was fined $200 (by a judge) for abusing his wife. He was suspended for 0 games.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDarren Collison, Jason Kidd, Jason Richardson. The NBA has a history of letting abusers off lightly. All just because they're good at basketball.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm a firm believer in forgiveness and giving people second chances but if Kyle Lowry and NBA fans think Mark Stevens should be banned for life then Kyle Lowry should've never become a Raptor, Jason Kidd should not be the league's highest paid assistant coach and Lance Stephenson should've never played a minute in the NBA. \n\n&nbsp; thanks for this OP i had no clue about any of these except kidd", "class": "r/nba"}, {"text": "[Charania] Spurs legend Tim Duncan has joined Gregg Popovich's coaching staff as an assistant coach. link SAN ANTONIO RUNS ON DUNCAN", "class": "r/nba"}, {"text": "Mamba mood link Dont know why but kobe looks like a roman official, or even emperor", "class": "r/nba"}, {"text": "Yao Ming on the state of Chinese basketball: \"If 10 years from now we still use Yao Ming to represent China, it's a failure on my job.

[Klay gets a point removed by Scott Foster](https://streamable.com/0nhtk).\n\nA major theme which showed itself was the fact that Ryan Anderson literally (I'm not kidding) hand checked Curry every time he was switched onto him.

He will join the Hawks so he can film Twister 2 with their owner\u2019s wife on their off days.\n\n**Boston Celtics**\n\nLeBron misses Kyrie. He wants to play basketball with his friend and that means playing for the Celtics.\n\nOR\n\nLeBron wants to troll Kyrie. He will go to Boston management and ask them to trade Kyrie back to Cleveland if they want him to join. Danny Ainge will agree because he has no heart.\n\n**Brooklyn Nets**\n\nLeBron loves NY. He will go to New York to sign with the Knicks to play in historic Madison Square Garden. However, during the drive to the stadium, his driver makes a wrong turn and they end up in Brooklyn. LeBron realizes the mistake, but shrugs his shoulders and signs with the Nets instead, because he will have the same results with either the Knicks or Nets.\n\n\n**Charlotte Hornets**\n\nLeBron wants to prove he\u2019s better than Michael Jordan. He will sign with the Hornets to taunt MJ directly. He will win the Finals in 2019 with the Hornets and won\u2019t let MJ touch the trophy. After the season, LeBron will buy out MJ\u2019s shares and he will become majority owner. He will then trade himself to a better team because Dwight is too annoying and nobody will agree to LeBron\u2019s trade proposals involving Dwight.\n\n**Chicago Bulls**\n\nLeBron wants to prove he\u2019s better than Michael Jordan. He will sign with the Bulls so he can win 7 championships to pass what MJ did.\n\n\n**Cleveland Cavaliers**\n\nLeBron loves Cleveland as much as he hates moving. LeBron will re-sign with the Cavs, because it\u2019s more convenient than moving to a different city.\n\n**Dallas Mavericks**\n\nLeBron is still haunted by the 2011 Finals. He will go to Dallas to learn from the true GOAT Dirk Nowitzki. There, LeBron will lead the Mavs all the way to the number 1 seed in the West, only to lose to the Warriors in the first round after KD leaves for India to re-join his snek charmer friend.\n\n**Denver Nuggets**\n\nLeBron loves chicken nuggets. He will sign with Denver, only to be disappointed. He then will retire and start his own chicken nugget company.\n\n**Detroit Pistons**\n\nLeBron will become the new Pistons President of Basketball Operations. His first act in his new role will be to sign himself as the head coach/starting SF. His second transaction will be to trade Blake Griffin to the Cavs for the 8th pick in the draft and salary filler, because LeBron will blackmail Dan Gilbert into doing it.\n\n**Golden State Warriors**\n\nLeBron wants all the ringz. He will sign with the Warriors for the veteran minimum so he can win not 1, not 2, not 3, not 4, not 5, not 6, not 7, not 8, not 9, but 10 championships.\n\n**Houston Rockets**\n\nLeBron loves space. He will sign with the Rockets so he can go to NASA and fly an actual rocket into space to find better competition on other planets. Mike Dan Tony will be confused why LeBron doesn\u2019t show up to their games. Mike, he\u2019s in space, deal with it.\n\n**Indiana Pacers**\n\nLeBron loves pace. He will sign with the Pacers so he can out-pace the other NBA players and win a championship. He will also become best friends with Lance Stephenson and the two will call out plays to each other by blowing in each other\u2019s rear, I mean ear.\n\n**LA Clippers**\n\nLeBron wants to live in Hollywood, but doesn\u2019t want to be under the shadow of Laker greats. If he can just lead the Clippers to the conference finals, they would rename their franchise LeBron\u2019s Clippers.\n\n**LA Lakers**\n\nLeBron wants to live in Hollywood, but doesn\u2019t want to be under the shadow of Clipper goods. He also wants to learn from the great Lavar Ball on how to play basketball as good as him.\n\n**Memphis Grizzlies**\n\nLeBron will not sign with the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\n**Miami Heat**\n\nLeBron will go back to Miami because he left his white headband there and wants it back.\n\n**Milwaukee Bucks**\n\nLeBron loves freaks. He will join the Greek Freak and sign with the Bucks. Then they will sign Rick James to preform every halftime so he can sing LeBron\u2019s favorite song \u201cSuper Freak\u201d\n\n**Minnesota Timberwolves**\n\nLeBron wants to learn from former MVP Derrick Rose. He also wants to torture his body and allow Coach Thibs to play him all 48 minutes for all 82 games.\n\n**New Orleans Pelicans**\n\nLeBron loves smoothies. He will join the Brow and sign with the Pelicans, so he can get unlimited smoothies at the Smoothie King Center.\n\n**New York Knicks**\n\nLeBron loves NY. He will go to New York to sign with the Knicks to play in historic Madison Square Garden. During the drive to the stadium, his driver makes the correct turn and they end up in MSG. LeBron realizes this and signs with the Knicks.\n\n**OKC Thunder**\n\nLeBron will sign with the Thunder so he can play with Russell Westbrook for one season, then leave after that and become an even better player.\n\n**Orlando Magic**\n\nLeBron will take his talents to Central Florida. He will sign with the Magic and lead them to another Finals lost.\n\n**Philadelphia 76ers**\n\nLeBron will sign with the 76ers because he trusts the process. LeBron will single handedly play bad for 3 seasons and tank so that the 76ers will get more draft picks to add to their squad. Then by age 37, LeBron will have what he needs to win another Eastern Conference Finals.\n\n**Phoenix Suns**\n\nLeBron loves hot-related teams. He will sign with the Suns and win 2 championships to prove to Pat Riley that he isn\u2019t so special with his so called \u201cHeat\u201d for the \u201cSuns\u201d are the hottest thing in the universe.\n\n**Portland Trail Blazers**\n\nLeBron loves Nike. He will sign with the Blazers so that he can spend his off days at Nike headquarters creating new shoes.\n\n**Sacramento Kings**\n\nLeBron is the King. He will sign with the Kings, because that\u2019s where he belongs.\n\n**San Antonio Spurs**\n\nLeBron loves Coach Pop. He will sign with the Spurs to learn from him, only to find out Coach Pop actually has no idea what he\u2019s doing and is just really lucky. LeBron will use that luck to convince Kawhy? To stay and they will win a championship every other year in 2019, 2021, and 2023.\n\n**Toronto Raptors**\n\nLeBron will sign with the Raptors just to check up on them and make sure they are ok.\n\n**Utah Jazz**\n\nLeBron loves jazz. He will sign with Utah only to find out they don\u2019t actually have jazz. He will then force a trade to New Orleans to be close to real jazz and because he remembered that he loves smoothies.\n\n**Washington Wizards**\n\nLeBron loves politics. He will sign with the Wizards so he can play basketball and also become the next president of the United States in 2020.\n\n\n\n**EDIT**\n\nSome of you have been asking for this, so here you go...\n\n**Seattle Supersonics**\n\nLeBron won't sign with this team because it doesn't exist. >doesn\u2019t want to be under the shadow of Laker greats\n\n>doesn\u2019t want to be under the shadow of Clipper goods", "class": "r/nba"}, {"text": "[Charania] San Antonio Spurs legend Manu Ginobili has retired from the NBA.
