In the span of his rants, he's claimed Drake bought out Pusha T's front rows in Toronto to cause a brawl, he sneak dissed him on SICKO MODE, Drake bullies people with mental health issues, only for Drake to end the first rant by calling him.\n\nKanye claimed 'Mission Accomplished' and the sample was not cleared. A couple hours later, Kanye is back and claiming Drake called to threaten his life, where he restated that XXX is dead and 6ix9ine are already in jail, only difference is Kanye is a family man. Kanye says he paved the way for Drake to come up in rap, and he shouldn't be giving the guy with pink polos the tough talk now. Essentially, respect your elders.\n\nAnd then gives a further deep dive into SICKO MODE, calling out Travis for allowing that to come out as a diss to his brother-in-law. Retracts some of the harsher statements which are mirrored below, but then tries to end (as of now?) on a positive note, saying to respect him while he's still here.\n\n---\n\n>[This proves shit faker than wrestling](https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1073319978579955712?s=21)\n\n[mirror](https://i.gyazo.com/596e572ad26c9b82a324df610775c087.png)\n\n>[Still need that apology for mentioning the 350s and trying to take food out your idols kids mouths](https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1073320212806684678)\n\n[mirror](https://i.gyazo.com/fbef670cf79c2719f4dd6bbd42d733be.png)\n\n>[Been trying to meet with you for 6 months bro       You sneak dissing on trav records and texting Kris talking bout how\u2019s the family](https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1073320449088675841)\n\n[mirror](https://i.gyazo.com/9d4c8ed5c3b3018c3ed2a8a36a8007bd.png)\n\n>[I told you I ain\u2019t tell Pusha about your son](https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1073320879705202691)\n\n[mirror](https://i.gyazo.com/f0a96cf0a12341fb8a786b507f24c25e.png)\n\n>[It\u2019s all love bro bro but don\u2019t play with me.

Cole (and his team) continues to gyp his fans out of merch for over 1 year I purchased an official, limited edition, autographed vinyl of J. Cole's KOD three days after the album first dropped from [https://www.jcoleshop.com/](https://www.jcoleshop.com/). It is now June 2019, and I never received anything in the mail for this purchase. I received a shipping confirmation email on April 24th, 2018 and an email \"Update Regarding Your Order from J. Cole\" on September 14, 2018.\n\nIn that update email, someone from J. Cole's merch team said that \"the signed LP jackets were damaged in transit and need to be re-manufactured and re-signed\" ... \"and these will now not ship out until late January 2019. We recognize that this is a long delay so if you would prefer to have your money refunded, please reply to this email to start that process.\"\n\nI am a college student, so I quickly let this slip my mind and I forgot about it, until I randomly remembered earlier this month (June 2019) and decided to email the merch team asking for any updates. In his merch team's defense, I did receive a quick response (on June 7th, 2019), but it was not very helpful. All they said was that \"unfortunately, we still do not have a confirmed timeline of when we will be receiving more inventory of the KOD Signed Vinyl.\"\n\nThey did also offer, again, to provide a refund, but I am a broke college student, so the likelihood of me being able to afford VIP tickets to get an autograph from one of my all-time favorite artists is little to none right now. I don't really want a refund. The $37 I paid is not going to change my life right now, but I would really value adding this vinyl to the little collection I'm starting to build up.\n\nPlease spare an upvote so that MAYBE some slight social media traction might provoke a more timely-effort to give J. Cole's supporters what they deserve. I can guarantee I am not the only one that this happened to.\n\n**\\*Edit:** I have just learned that \"gyp\" is a derogatory slur that delegitimizes the historical plight of the Romani (and Egyptian) people. For whatever reason, \"jip\" came to me when writing the title and I just quickly used google dictionary to get the correct spelling.

Some background:\nSo I go to Berklee in Boston. I'm the second person to ever get in for rapping, so I'm blessed with a lot of really great opportunities and talent to work with. I've been working on a project since I got here I was supposed to release friday. \n\nWednesday night, I get linked from a few band members this kid who I'd vaguely seen twice had written a diss track on me, posted it everywhere. All the class pages, the fucking secret Boston page, twitter-- everywhere. \n\nHere's that: https://soundcloud.com/kiswamusic/back-and-forth\n\nI STRAIGHT UP THOUGHT THIS HAD TO BE SOME FUCKING JOKE. The times I had seen this dude, I'd been super fucking nice to him. I'd seen him a week earlier like \"yo, lets chill and catch up. No business for once.\" I thought this dude was trying to just get people hype. So I write a quick 16 response but don't record it yet. Then he decides to post all this shit on Facebook like \"Zaid's a bitch\", walk around campus talking a mess of shit about me. Keep in mind, Berklee is a big fucking music school-- a lot of these people get jobs in the industry-- it's a huge networking hub. That's my reputation he's DIRECTLY impacting. SO I write a fuck ton more, we get the three best producers in the school to collab on the track and respond: \n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/zaidtmusic/the-last-supperkiswa-diss\n\n1 for 1. Did it that night, we got a studio and recorded it.\n\nHere's the thing. I had no idea how big of a fucking deal this was around Berklee. Fucking teachers were asking students about it. Everybody was talking about it. I straight up walked into the 150 lobby to applause yo. There's meme's of this dude on a bunch of peoples profiles with his face photoshopped on a fucking cucumber. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/jgcWGP7\n\n11am I receive a text from said bodied motherfucker going like\n\n\"It was a publicity stunt. Nothing personal, just wanted to see how I could manipulate a fanbase\"\n\nLOL. foh. I told him to take the L and apologize for some stupid shit he couldn't deal with. He's like \"nah, best decision I ever made\". I'm like \"STRAIGHT\". Ima be real, I started battling a long ass time ago, and there are motherfuckers who understand where they're at-- take the L and squash, and people too stupid to understand it. Everytime I've lost a battle, I've been real about it like \"yo, good shit, I'ma come back harder.\" I leave it be. But this dude too stupid to see that not only did he burn one bridge, he burned pretty much all of them at this school because he started some unnecessary shit. And then came around and started messaging people \n\"oh no I didn't mean it!\"\n\nidk, i just wanted to share with ya'll some hilarious shit, because I've popped up on here a couple times, and I thought it was worth the story. And the dude does look like a motherfucking cucumber. \n\nTL;DR: I go to Berklee for rapping and some kid wrote a diss track on me. I responded. A lot of people knew about it. Now everybody talks about how this kid looks like a cucumber. And I posted it here because I thought it was funny, and ya'll are family. \n\n**UPDATE: HOLY SHIT!

I want to share it with you all and say thanks. Hey everyone, in the past six years you\u2019ve probably seen me around on r/hiphopimages or r/freshalbumart sharing my work, or the occasional times I actually stop lurking and post here. I want to give a big thanks to all of the content that is posted here (this includes the shitposting). It\u2019s helped me find inspiration and links to new music. Six years ago when I was a junior in college, I created my first hiphop illustrations of Lupe Fiasco and Kanye West. After I finished ten of them, I thought it would be sick if I made three more and turned them into a card deck! So I did that which you can see [here](http://imgur.com/a/RNC84 ). These were hand printed and cut (fun senior project). At this point I knew that I wanted to create a full 52 card deck. I just didn\u2019t know it would be five years later lol.\n\nThis has kind of been my passion project after work. I\u2019ll spend a few hours here and there, and some weekends working on this. It\u2019s not my full-time job, but I just enjoy creating and this has been an outlet for me. \n\nHere\u2019s a link to the full deck: \n\n[Hiphop illustrative card deck](https://imgur.com/gallery/AgDMsvu)\n\nBreakdown of which artists are on which card:\n\n[Breakdown Cards](https://imgur.com/a/EmZkXqn)\n\nI need to give a very large shoutout to my friend [Parker Gibson](https://www.instagram.com/helloparkerg/) whom I collaborated with on the Vince Staples, Freddie Gibbs, and Pusha T piece. As well as a shout out to [Frawgsy](https://www.instagram.com/frawgsy/) for working on the Ski Mask piece with me. These are both talented artists worth following. \n\nAlso I do have these for sale on my site [Brandonspahn.com](https://brandonspahn.com/shop/), but I don't want to make this post focused on that. I\u2019m just really proud of this work as I\u2019ve spent between 600-800 hours of my life working on it, and I wanted to share this link in case someone is interested. I set up a promo code for Reddit though, if you use \u201cReddit\u201d, you\u2019ll save 10%. I talked with the mods to make sure that this was okay to post as well. If you'd like to see more of my work or more detailed shots of the art, my instagram is https://www.instagram.com/brandonspahnart/.\n\nAnyways thanks again for this subreddit, it\u2019s the only one I\u2019ve been active on for all eight years of my Redditing.

I can't believe I'm writing this. I also don't know why I'm so surprised. But... Here we go.\n\nI've seen a lot of hip hop shows, a lot of underground acts and this was the first show I was going to see a \"mumble rapper\". After seeing all his show footage it seemed like it'd be madness and I been following Lil Purp for over a year now. So we went to Starland Ballroom in NJ last night to go see him. Not only did I sit through 3 and a half hours of the worst openers I've ever seen, but the DJs were playing obnoxiously long sets with Lil Pump, XXX, and Ski Mask on repeat... but they were the same 3 songs. That's Okay, I thought, it's basically time for Smokepurpp.\n\nNot only did they keep saying one more song. Then three more songs and he'll come out.... He came out late as hell and he was leaning and geeked so hard.\n\nHere's his set list (did not play any of these all the way thru):\nAudi,\nGeek A Lot,\nBless Yo Trap,\nDrop,\nFingers Blue,\nAudi (again)\n\nWhat the fuck. I sat through 3.5 hours for a fucking 15 min set... where he played Audi twice. Not to mention 2 other songs he played in his set were Uzi and Waka songs.\n\nAftwr taking so long he said \"theres no rules for lil purpp\"... I feel like I was finessed by an artist I actually really fuck with. I'm pretty tight. \n\nTl/dr; Smokepurpp doesn't give a fuck about his fans dont go see him. Go see an artist that'll put on an actual show. \n\nEDIT: I am not saying fuck Smokepurpp I still think the dude makes enjoyable music, just a little warning to anyone thinkin about spending time or money at one of his shows. Purpp opened for post Malone and wow worst set I have ever seen. \n\nHe has no stamina, was out of breath after half a verse.\n\nHe said he was on xan and had to pee after performing one song. So he left for 10 minutes. Maybe he had to poo? He comes back 10 minutes later and was awful.\n\nI\u2019ve never seen a worse performance in my life.

We don\u2019t need to Loose anybody else. link I've been on a path to educate people on benzodiazepine (Xanax, Klonopin, Valium, etc) withdrawals IRL and on the internet. **I really hope this post gets some attention because the info is important.**\n\n\n**Benzos and alcohol are the only two classes of drugs that can kill you when withdrawing from them.**\n\n\nI'll try to keep it simple. Benzos (and alcohol) work by making a neurotransmitter, GABA, more effective when it binds to the brain. GABA basically reduces how strong/powerful nerve impulses are, so when you're anxious and on edge, these drugs will sedate and chill you out by reducing the excitability of the brain cells associated with anxiety, muscle stiffness, etc.\n\n\nWhen you take both drugs for a long time and suddenly stop, you start with rebound anxiety. Your neurons start going into hyperactive mode because the GABA is less effective after you artificially strengthened them by taking Xanax and drinking a lot. A few days later, your brain starts going really hyperactive and you can experience things like delirium tremens, seizures, and die. **It's long suspected that rappers like Lil Wayne and G Herbo have had seizures due to benzo dependence.**\n\n\nWhat's worse? Benzos can cause post acute withdrawal symptoms that can start days or weeks after your last dose. You think you're fine and recovered until you start experiencing awful symptoms of anxiety, panic, tetany, and even seizures depending on how much you were dosing and how often. **I know from personal experience with friends who are still struggling with withdrawal issues 2 years after quitting.**\n\n\n**Xanax is not cool. Percocets are not cool.** They are big pharma literally making you dependent on them for life for $$$. No matter how much of a badass you think you are, you are absolutely fucked if you take these drugs for a long period of time. \n\n\nIf you are taking more than 4 mg of Xanax, 4 mg of Klonopin, or 40 mg of Valium a day, you can die if you miss your doses. **PLEASE GET HELP NOW**. Seriously, do not quit cold turkey. You need a professional to help you taper and when you do go get help, mention something known as the **Ashton Manual created by Dr. Heather Ashton**. It will limit your chance of seizing and dying by titrating your dose down.\n\n\nThere's a ton more info I can provide on this topic through my years of drug education and research. Please PM me if you need help. I'm very cognizant of drugs I put in my body and I whole heartedly believe that benzos are the next major epidemic for our generation and that the effects of this class of drugs are going to lead to way more issues than the opiate epidemic we have right now.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n**EDIT: I see this post is blowing up so I want to clarify a few things!**\n\n\n**1)** I'm not a licensed medical professional. I am an engineer with a lot of self-taught knowledge on psychology, neurology, and biochemistry. **The number 1 piece of advice for anyone who feels like they are in a serious situation is to go to a doctor. Check yourself into an inpatient ER if you need to. But make sure you discuss that you are fearing seizures/withdrawals and you need to be checked in and monitored**.\n\n\n**2)** I did not mean to downplay the severity of opiate withdrawals. There have been a few documented cases of opiate withdrawal related seizures and deaths. It is just far more likely to occur when withdrawing from GABAergic drugs. This means that sleeping pills, RC benzo/thienodiazepines (like Etizolam), GHB/GBL, barbiturates can all manifest themselves into benzo withdrawal symptoms. Please get help if you think you need it!\n\n\n**3)** I'm going to put together a list of resources and supplements in a document so I can post it here later. Please do not use it as medical literature, but it is there to help those of you who are really struggling at least cope a bit better. \n\n\n**4)** I know about fake presses, fent getting into pills, etc. I also understand Peep had a polydrug overdose. However, that doesn't take away from the fact that both drugs he took can be lethal by themselves. It also emphasizes the importance of not buying fake presses online and for harm reduction purposes, trying a small amount before dosing large quantities of pills.\n\n\n**5)** While I put together my resources, here are a few pointers that are quick wins:\n\na) CBD and Magnesium supplements helped me quite a bit. Everyone can be different but there is sound research out there supporting this. Calcium deficiencies may also cause some of your symptoms. The best idea is to get some lab work done to see if you are deficient.\n\nb) Do not go cold turkey if you're on any dose of benzos. Talk to your doctor before making any decision to stop taking your drugs.\n\nc) Beta blockers do a good job of stopping physical anxiety symptoms. They are also not habit forming and not addictive. Talk to your doctor about this.\n\n\n\n**REMEMBER: You all matter and deserve to break free from your demons. You're not alone in your battles and if you're struggling, know that you have amazing people ready to listen and support you even if it doesn't seem like it. Please find good providers who listen to you and use medical intervention when necessary. I've been getting tons of messages and trying to get back to all of them but if I miss yours, please don't feel bad! I'm extremely busy with life right now so I may not get to everything right away.

It doesn't exist because it never happened. You don't get to control someone's emotional response to being called 'that bitch' in front of the entire world. Of course I wanted to like the song. i wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship. He promised to play the song for m, but he never did. While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot 'approve' a song you haven't heard.
