Even as a kid against 6-11 men his own size playing professionally (such as former Harlem Globetrotters!) he averaged 53.9ppg by age 17. I found game recaps of multiple 46 point performances for the Quakertown Fay's at age 17, and at least one 44 point game even at age 16 for the Pittsburgh Raiders.\n\nThis is not only not often talked about, it's NEVER talked about. I've seen only a few references to his professional career that predated college basketball. When I researched this I found out it got him into potential trouble with the NCAA and so it was kept hushed and perhaps left to be forgotten.\n\n*EDIT* Allow me to plug one other researcher who I've come to learn first shared the photographs of Wilt playing for the Fay's a few years ago.

He \"only\" averaged 40.5ppg in 9 regular season games but with playoffs combined his 15 game average shoots up to 53.9ppg! This means 74ppg in the 6 playoff games as a Fay. I'm not sure if this is even possible so please take with a grain of salt. Though he did score 90 points in high school and 100 in the NBA including 5 other 70+ point games so who knows.

It doesn't exist because it never happened. You don't get to control someone's emotional response to being called 'that bitch' in front of the entire world. Of course I wanted to like the song. i wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship. He promised to play the song for m, but he never did. While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot 'approve' a song you haven't heard. Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination. I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I never asked to be a part of, since 2009.*\n\nSo first her PR team say there was no phone call, suddenly she never heard a certain part.\n\nAlso here's a better video of the snapchat story, credit /u/Pootrick2: https://flipagram.com/f/sfbgiK4bPf\n\n**Every snapchat vid is Kanye talking to Taylor or vice versa over the phone.**\n\n**Snapchat 1**  \nKanye: Oh ok do, you still got- you still got the Nashville number?  \nTaylor: I do still have the Nashville area code but, I had to change it\n\n**Snapchat 2**  \nKanye: For all my south side niggas that know me best...

It's obviously very tongue in cheek either way\n\n**Snapchat 6**  \nTaylor: I really appreciate you telling me about it!
