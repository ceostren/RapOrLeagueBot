We don\u2019t need to Loose anybody else. link I've been on a path to educate people on benzodiazepine (Xanax, Klonopin, Valium, etc) withdrawals IRL and on the internet. **I really hope this post gets some attention because the info is important.**\n\n\n**Benzos and alcohol are the only two classes of drugs that can kill you when withdrawing from them.**\n\n\nI'll try to keep it simple. Benzos (and alcohol) work by making a neurotransmitter, GABA, more effective when it binds to the brain. GABA basically reduces how strong/powerful nerve impulses are, so when you're anxious and on edge, these drugs will sedate and chill you out by reducing the excitability of the brain cells associated with anxiety, muscle stiffness, etc.\n\n\nWhen you take both drugs for a long time and suddenly stop, you start with rebound anxiety. Your neurons start going into hyperactive mode because the GABA is less effective after you artificially strengthened them by taking Xanax and drinking a lot. A few days later, your brain starts going really hyperactive and you can experience things like delirium tremens, seizures, and die. **It's long suspected that rappers like Lil Wayne and G Herbo have had seizures due to benzo dependence.**\n\n\nWhat's worse? Benzos can cause post acute withdrawal symptoms that can start days or weeks after your last dose. You think you're fine and recovered until you start experiencing awful symptoms of anxiety, panic, tetany, and even seizures depending on how much you were dosing and how often. **I know from personal experience with friends who are still struggling with withdrawal issues 2 years after quitting.**\n\n\n**Xanax is not cool. Percocets are not cool.** They are big pharma literally making you dependent on them for life for $$$. No matter how much of a badass you think you are, you are absolutely fucked if you take these drugs for a long period of time. \n\n\nIf you are taking more than 4 mg of Xanax, 4 mg of Klonopin, or 40 mg of Valium a day, you can die if you miss your doses. **PLEASE GET HELP NOW**. Seriously, do not quit cold turkey. You need a professional to help you taper and when you do go get help, mention something known as the **Ashton Manual created by Dr. Heather Ashton**. It will limit your chance of seizing and dying by titrating your dose down.\n\n\nThere's a ton more info I can provide on this topic through my years of drug education and research. Please PM me if you need help. I'm very cognizant of drugs I put in my body and I whole heartedly believe that benzos are the next major epidemic for our generation and that the effects of this class of drugs are going to lead to way more issues than the opiate epidemic we have right now.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n**EDIT: I see this post is blowing up so I want to clarify a few things!**\n\n\n**1)** I'm not a licensed medical professional. I am an engineer with a lot of self-taught knowledge on psychology, neurology, and biochemistry. **The number 1 piece of advice for anyone who feels like they are in a serious situation is to go to a doctor. Check yourself into an inpatient ER if you need to. But make sure you discuss that you are fearing seizures/withdrawals and you need to be checked in and monitored**.\n\n\n**2)** I did not mean to downplay the severity of opiate withdrawals. There have been a few documented cases of opiate withdrawal related seizures and deaths. It is just far more likely to occur when withdrawing from GABAergic drugs. This means that sleeping pills, RC benzo/thienodiazepines (like Etizolam), GHB/GBL, barbiturates can all manifest themselves into benzo withdrawal symptoms. Please get help if you think you need it!\n\n\n**3)** I'm going to put together a list of resources and supplements in a document so I can post it here later. Please do not use it as medical literature, but it is there to help those of you who are really struggling at least cope a bit better. \n\n\n**4)** I know about fake presses, fent getting into pills, etc. I also understand Peep had a polydrug overdose. However, that doesn't take away from the fact that both drugs he took can be lethal by themselves. It also emphasizes the importance of not buying fake presses online and for harm reduction purposes, trying a small amount before dosing large quantities of pills.\n\n\n**5)** While I put together my resources, here are a few pointers that are quick wins:\n\na) CBD and Magnesium supplements helped me quite a bit. Everyone can be different but there is sound research out there supporting this. Calcium deficiencies may also cause some of your symptoms. The best idea is to get some lab work done to see if you are deficient.\n\nb) Do not go cold turkey if you're on any dose of benzos. Talk to your doctor before making any decision to stop taking your drugs.\n\nc) Beta blockers do a good job of stopping physical anxiety symptoms. They are also not habit forming and not addictive. Talk to your doctor about this.\n\n\n\n**REMEMBER: You all matter and deserve to break free from your demons. You're not alone in your battles and if you're struggling, know that you have amazing people ready to listen and support you even if it doesn't seem like it. Please find good providers who listen to you and use medical intervention when necessary. I've been getting tons of messages and trying to get back to all of them but if I miss yours, please don't feel bad! I'm extremely busy with life right now so I may not get to everything right away.
